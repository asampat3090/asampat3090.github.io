But these topics have been around for ages ‚Äî albeit with names that have changed over the years. The types of problems that developers solve in these fields all fit into what we call Quantitative Workflows ‚Äî the process of starting with data and deriving insights, actions, and quantitative models.\nAnd the developers that create them? They are the researchers, hobbyists, developers, data scientists, analysts, among many others who collectively are the Quantitative oriented Developers (QoDs).\nThere are a number of workflows that fit into these paradigms, but the world today needs a lot more QoDs than we currently have.\nNaturally much has been written on the democratization of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and getting to that requires QoDs who can implement them. The reasons for it are typically stated as follows: it‚Äôs the future, access shouldn‚Äôt be limited to a special class of people, its value will be experienced by everyone and it should be created by anyone with the desire. Unfortunately the goal of making quantitative workflows available to everyone still leaves much to be desired.\n\n‚Äú AI is about to create a fantastic amount of opportunities, and these opportunities should not be reserved to Ivy League grads, or to people born in the US. They should be open to all. ‚Äù\n‚Äî Fran√ßois Chollet, Author of Keras\n\nThese wonderful ideals are all but realized. Although efforts are being made and resources being built to make these quantitative workflows more accessible, the community lacks a cohesive, coherent, and collaborative platform to transfer knowledge between QoDs, and prospective QoDs.\nThere are a number of disparate machine learning frameworks that are all growing exponentially.\nAs QoDs of different backgrounds, fluency, and training in basic statistics, machine learning concepts, and software attack the myriad problems in research and industry they are searching for a common and accessible methods of collaboration.\nToday, the biggest pain points QoDs face is a disconnect when they want to work through their quantitative workflows. Below are 3 key parts of the process and the biggest issue in each one.\n\nTracking &amp; Reproducibility: Finding previous configurations, dependencies, and environments to reproduce or build on top of your own or another person‚Äôs work\nCollaboration: Sharing with or understanding a model from another person, and tweaking that model to fit custom data and configurations\nDeployment: Converting a model to work in production once it‚Äôs ready and keeping that deployed model up to date with new observations\n\nLet‚Äôs go through a quick example using a computer vision algorithm for face recognition. There are several computer vision approaches to identifying someone‚Äôs face in an image. To leverage one of these approaches a QoD must:\n\nreproduce the same environment that was used in the approach (usually all they have is a code repository, not the full environment). They might find some direction on this through a readme, description or blog written by the author of the approach, but the reproducibility of an approach is unclear.\nsee how the approach works on the type of data they intend to use the model for. (For example, if I‚Äôm working with images of people in a crowd, that would be very different from images of people in a news interview.) The developer then has to tweak a variety of parameters from the original method to work on the nuances of their data until they get good accuracy.\nrelease the model into production (into the wild), and track performance so they can incorporate any learned feedback to improve the model further.\n\nIn order to solve these, the three missing pieces in today‚Äôs workflows are:\n\nTracking &amp; Reproducibility: Easy replication of configurations and environments to reproduce or build on previous work\nCollaboration: Automatic tracking of configurations, environments, and methodology and easy accessibility to these metrics from other‚Äôs\nDeployment: Simple deployment to handle production data and real-time feedback to monitor performance and incorporate new observations\n\nThe not so distant future holds an open network where collaborators use the best practices above to aggregate the best models, approaches, and methodologies allowing QoDs to learn from and build on top of their work. In today‚Äôs networked paradigm it is still the case that we ‚Äúsee further‚Äù by standing on the shoulders of giants, however, an observer might add that our weight is also borne by millions of normal people.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in being a part of this network early on, let us know.

While tracking and reproducing work for most generic web-connected applications and workflows is becoming more standardized (i.e., document state-saving and tracking through Google Docs and code version control system like Github) there is currently no widely accepted standard or simple automation for data science and machine learning. This is not to say developers and data scientists don‚Äôt track their work, but their process tends to be rinse and repeat, time-consuming, and rarely automated.\ncomplex, time-consuming, and precarious process\nNot only is keeping track of the state of your work an important part of getting things done, but automating and observing best practices in tracking also drives better productivity and collaboration. Below, we propose some best practices and an open source system for solving tracking and reproducibility when working with data and machine learning. Furthermore, we introduce a new way to automate this process. Let‚Äôs start with the goals that we strive to achieve.\nTracking Goals\n\nPrevent lost history of your trained models, configurations, metrics, and environments\nEnsure accurate reporting of results\nAvoid errors when repeating, learning from, and reproducing someone else‚Äôs work (or even your own work!)\n\nBroadly we can categorize tracking in data projects into 5 sections: code, configurations, environments, performance metrics, and files. Below we break down the current workflow and problems with it, some best practices for handling these workflows and the Datmo equivalents for the best practices.\nTracking Problems with Existing Solutions\nBest Practices with Existing Solutions\nDatmo Solution\nKeeping track of workflows while working with and modeling data shouldn‚Äôt be like pulling teeth. Datmo‚Äôs simple command-line interface takes into account the common workflows and best practices that data scientists and developers are used to, and automates the entire tracking process.\nMore specifically, Datmo enables tracking all 5 components above via Snapshots of models. In addition, Datmo enables simple orchestration of tasks and runs to ensure replicability of snapshots across machines. Datmo provides 2 main value propositions:\n\nTracks models via snapshots, which are points in time of a trained model\nEnables orchestration for running tasks run in parallel and maintaining isolated results\n\nDatmo‚Äôs CLI along with GUI platform allows you to build, track, share, and collaborate on data projects. This allows collaborators to see all of the work you did, including snapshots and task runs. These collaborators can now improve, comment and work on new experiments from there improving the way everyone works on their data projects.\nIf you want to get access and play around with our Datmo CLI and GUI, click here, sign up, and send an email to me at anand@datmo.com and I‚Äôll be sure to send you an invite code :).\nWe hope no one will ever have to deal with the issue of tracking work manually ever again.

The main goal: get the model to recognize Donald Trump in images, videos, and gifs with as high confidence as possible. The sub-goal: Alex wanted Ignacio‚Äôs help in improving the model for practical use cases, specifically when being used on a set of 10,000 new labelled images they received from a customer. Since the new images are from ‚Äúthe wild‚Äù many times they include multiple people, and a variety of new elements in the frame. He wants Ignacio‚Äôs help in determining how to make sure the model still works for these images. The first step: Alex needed to share the most recent iteration of the model with Ignacio, and this is where the collaboration process started to break.\nWhat does sharing a model really mean?\nThere are a few components necessary to make the model Alex created available to my colleagues, people around the world, or himself (on a different server or computer for example).\n\nCode ‚Äî How can Alex share the raw code he has created with Ignacio?\nData ‚Äî Where‚Äôs the data Alex had used originally, how can Ignacio add the new data set to retrain the model? Can they access the data through different locations or do they have to be on the same server at the same time? Is there concurrent access of the data?\nModel Snapshots ‚Äî How can Alex share the snapshots of different parts of his experiments with Ignacio?\nEnvironmental Dependencies ‚Äî How can Alex ensure Ignacio can run these experiments in the same way he did?\nMethodology ‚Äî How does Ignacio reproduce the steps Alex‚Äôs took in his work? Has Alex kept track of the experiments that he has run and the snapshots of the models he has created? Has he kept a log of why he ran the experiments he did?\nCompute Resources ‚Äî What computational resources will Ignacio need to run Alex‚Äôs latest model? Will Alex need to share the resources with him?\n\nDetails on each of the components and what they look like for Alex.\nWhen Ignacio finally does set up and complete work Alex‚Äôs model, how does he share it back? How do they test, deploy, and get feedback incorporated to improve the model once it is in production? Closing these loops are really important to successfully collaborate on a machine learning project. Unfortunately the process today is extremely broken.\nHere are Alex‚Äôs options today\nCommon ways to collaborate and share each of these components today.\nThankfully there are a set of best practices that if implemented result in the best possible results with current tools.\nBest Practices for Collaboration in AI\nWe collated these from our own experiences and a series of interviews we‚Äôve conducted with people and teams working on machine learning from a number of organizations including Google, Facebook, Uber, Intuit, Stanford AI Lab.\nBest practices to collaborate on each one of these components.\nThe story of Alex and Ignacio is really the story of why we started Datmo. Starting with our Command Line Interface (CLI) and our GUI, our mission is to become the collaborative platform that helps democratize and drive forward artificial intelligence into real-world applications. For Alex and Ignacio, this is what their process looks like in Datmo.\nThe Datmo way to collaborate. Keep it simple!\nWith our tools we are solving the problem of tracking and sharing your work (you can check out our blog post on the topic here) as well as collaboration between team members. We do this with a Command Line Interface that tracks model training sessions and keeps snapshots of the models associated with different parameters and configurations you might run. We also greatly simplify the environment setup, compute handling and deployment by leveraging Docker. Finally, we make plugging new data and new models together super easy with the concept of data contracts which define interaction between models and data (we‚Äôll be posting a blog about that in the near future). Our easy-to-use GUI allows developers building these algorithms to instantly share their models with collaborators and colleagues and visualize their work directly in the web browser. No more fiddling around with shared servers, cloud storage, or manual bookkeeping.\nTo take advantage of our free tools, sign up for our beta at datmo.io.

The technology is exciting ‚Äî predictive intelligence and classification, for example, have great disruptive potential and enable organizations to build competitive advantages with their own data. Before putting data and models to work, however, one must consider the iterative development and versioning, deployment orchestration, and feedback cycle in the context of the application and the teams responsible for making it work.\nThe Ideal Lifecycle of Model Deployment &amp; Iteration\nFor example, let‚Äôs say I run an e-commerce business and have been tracking conversion data to build a recommendation algorithm. I might want to answer the question: what products should I send to a user via email or social media to inspire a new purchase? Then I can define the problem as utilizing user information and outputting the likelihood of a given customer to convert on a particular product. Once I have the problem definition, I have to identify and mobilize the right teams to figure out a solution. Part of finding the right people means making sure you have people who can gather the data, select the models, format the data, train the models, and iterate until you have a satisfactory solution.\nOnce you have that, you finally get the deployment where the goal is to deploy my model as a RESTful API or a microservice so it can be easily plugged into the current enterprise workflow. I can easily run analyses in batch to determine conversions or in some cases, I may also want to to continuously train my system using historical and new user data along with a ground truth value of whether or not they converted. When doing all of this, I want to run my model on real data, iterate, and analyze results to see if my recommendations increase user engagement and conversion. Based on the data I generate from the results, I can then reassess and refine my problem or I can feed the data into a continuous learning loop.\nCompanies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are in the process or have already assembled teams, including people responsible for machine learning development, infrastructure and product so that they can create loops to take full advantage of machine learning in all of their products. In our experience even the biggest and most innovative organizations in the world haven‚Äôt fully figured out how to co-ordinate and collaborate between these teams, so they can effectively build and deploy machine learning solutions to production. The ones who have addressed this collaboration problem head on are starting to reap the benefits. Think products like Google search and photos, Facebook newsfeed and recommendations, and Uber‚Äôs routing algorithms.\nOur definitions of a model deployment in this article really encapsulate 2 major concepts: 1) the static machine learning model which you might choose during Model Selection, but most importantly 2) the features, weights, and meta information associated with it. What this means is that every time you train a model, a new snapshot is created which includes all of the meta information. When we deploy a model we really mean we are taking one snapshot of it and running it in production and when we go through the loop one more (or many more) times, we create new snapshots that improve performance over time.\nAs for the process, Model Deployment a two part process (and both parts are equally important):\n\nProduction Deployment: Generally a machine learning model, in order to work in production, must be scalable, accurate, and simple.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in many enterprises, data science and dev ops teams are separate entities, which results in a lag in deploying RESTful APIs or microservices.\n\n\nAnalysis and Monitoring: Track the performance of AI models on a continuous stream of data to find out what works best and iterate.\n\n\nAgain, because dev ops and analytics teams might be separate, there is no single ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù to tell each team what is working.\n\nThis two part process must happen in unison while keeping teams on the same page. We have observed that getting the right teams to work together in this collaborative process with all parties in sync is the biggest barrier to deploying effective machine learning systems into production.\nWhat Enterprise Machine Learning Deployment Really Looks Like Today\nMany large and data driven companies have built (or are building) extensive pipelines and internal workflow tools to handle this lifecycle. Unfortunately, the process is often disjoint across teams and maintaining the workflow is not scalable. Below are the key problems faced in creating a pipeline today and the teams that deal with them:\nData Preprocessing\n\nData gathering and munging is done for every analysis. No easy way to reproduce.\n\nModel Development\n\nCreating and training models is manual and slow, performance is evaluated individually. Checking hyper parameters is manual and not well documented. Other stakeholders are unable to see results on the fly.\n\nResource Coordination\n\nModel training requires orchestration and quick experimentation using different configuration parameters.\n\nModel Validation\n\nValidate that the model is working and meets the KPIs needed for the product by testing it on real live validation sets and improving the model on the fly.\n\nProduction Analytics\n\nGathering feedback data from production and continuously feeding that back to retrain models scalably to iterate quickly.\n\nDeployment\n\nDeploying models in production is slow and is manually scaled up. Multiple teams are tracking models and how they perform in separate locations ‚Äî there is no single ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for all stakeholders to monitor performance KPIs.\n\nBest Practices for Deployment &amp; How Datmo Helps\nDatmo‚Äôs Realtime Dashboard. More about this in Part 2 :)\nLuckily for each of the problems above, there is a better way to help the teams work together toward a common business goal.\nData Preprocessing\n\nEnsure configuration parameters are separated out from the model definition, so you can quickly preprocess your data without messing with the model. Datmo keeps track of these configurations\nKeep any feature engineering on data separate from model definitions. Datmo monitors feature engineering through model snapshots.\n\nModel Development\n\nVersion your model snapshots/iterations. Datmo automatically keeps track of your model iterations including data, features, and snapshots and any data preprocessing done above.\nRun your code within containers. Datmo makes your models automatically scalable with containerization to ensure you can run any snapshot from anywhere.\n\nResource Coordination\n\nRun a number of training tasks in parallel with different configurations to create performant models faster. Datmo orchestrates isolated parallel tasks on any machine\n\nModel Validation\n\nPipe real live data into your models to quickly assess performance and validate your models. Datmo enables validation orchestration on live data and batched historical data\nCreate automated validation tests for the production code at regular intervals on subsets of data. Datmo enables models deployed in production to be tested at regular intervals.\n\nProduction Analytics\n\nMonitor a realtime dashboard to see the performance on live data and sift through different time windows to analyze historical trends. Datmo has a single dashboard to monitor all models\n\nDeployment\n\nPackage your trained model into an easy-to-run container and monitor all of the statistics in one place so all stakeholders can view results. Datmo‚Äôs Realtime Dashboard keeps track of all deployments and enables you to diagnose and fix issues in minutes.\nSwap out the latest version of the snapshot to ensure the highest performance in production. Datmo enables a simple one click replacement of snapshot.\n\nConclusion\nThe process for creating, deploying and managing machine learning in everyday applications may seem complex, but it‚Äôs really an iterative loop. It involves a massive amount of coordination and collaboration, but it can be boiled down to some essentials that can be solved for. We‚Äôre working to simplify collaboration and improve this process to make it seamless while fitting into a familiar workflow for developers. Datmo enables the people building and maintaining AI to work together, and simplifies this iterative loop.\nStay tuned for part 2 of our series on Deployment to find out how Datmo makes deployment a piece of cake and learn about how you can use those features to monitor your own work.\nTo take advantage of our free tools, sign up for our beta at datmo.com.

You may already know the basics.\nSeptember 15, 2017\nOriginal Link: medium.com/datmo/learning-data-science-you-may-already-know-the-basics-64c9d764bcbb\nThere are countless people trying to get into data science lately, but many are intimidated by the idea of learning a new workflow. In just the last year alone, the number of people reading about and interacting with machine learning has jumped from ~100k in 2016 to over 10 million in 2017 worldwide.\nThe two biggest camps of people learning data science are software engineers looking to learn about quantitative development, and quantitative-oriented mathematicians and statisticians looking to scale their analysis and impact using machine learning (ML) and advanced analysis.\nFor software engineers, there are actually a lot of similarities to the ‚Äúplan-build-test-deploy‚Äù (PBTD) process that you already know well.\nThe PBTD loop you already know and love\nWe‚Äôre going to break down the data science development and production pipeline, and show how you can leverage the knowledge you already have about the PBTD workflow to hit the ground running.\n\nData Science follows the same PBTD loop you already know and love.\n\nData Science and Software Development follow the same loops.\nWhile the process looks the same at the high level, there are some specifics that make data science slightly different.\nPlan\n\n‚ÄúEvery extra minute spent planning is 10 minutes less spent debugging‚Äù\n\nPlanning with a team\nData science, just like any task, requires planning; much like software engineering, developing a specification is part of the game. Here are the key steps:\nIdentify business needs and create metrics: leverage business stakeholder knowledge to identify business needs and translate those needs into metrics that can be reliably measured. Machine learning needs certain values to minimize or maximize to assess its effectiveness.\nDesign experiments: come up with a set of experiments to generate the metrics you care about and identify the algorithms you need to use to get the desired results.\nBuild\nBuilding and iterating is a constant process\nOnce you‚Äôve come up with a plan, you can start to build your system. In software engineering this is is where you write your app‚Äôs code. In data science it‚Äôs just a few more steps:\nEnvironment setup: Based on the algorithm and experiment architecture you planned for, identify the library and framework dependencies you have (e.g. numpy, pandas, Python 2.7, TensorFlow, etc). Then set it up on the required hardware (local vs. distributed solutions).\nData Exploration: Explore the data tables or sources that can help generate the metrics you care about. This is where you clean your data, extract relavent variables, and engineer features that will be fed as inputs into your machine learning algorithm.\nModel Generation: Write the code that executes the algorithm you have chosen. This is the crux of the data science process and has a few key components:\n\nAlgorithm selection: select the model that makes most sense e.g. linear regression, random forests, neural network, etc.\nDebugging: The model only works if the code that generate it can execute your algorithm and data cleaning steps without error. This can manifest as a runtime/compilation error or a functional error which may process data incorrectly and thus result in a broken model.\nOptimization: All data analysis, including machine learning algorithms, are optimizations without a global maxima or minima. That‚Äôs just fancy parlance for saying it is not guaranteed you will get an answer in a given time. Unlike software engineering where you are programming functions with deterministic outputs, here, these processes are non-deterministic. In order to optimize, you will need to tune hyperparameters which teach the machine learning optimization function to calculate the best ‚Äúweights‚Äù by minimizing a variable known as the  loss function. We can think of this as a ‚Äúcompilation‚Äù step of data science. In software engineering, this step turns our code into binary machine language, in data science the data is turned into ‚Äúweights‚Äù of the model via this optimization process.\n\nTest\nTesting your work\nTesting in software comes in many different forms. For data science, there are a few types which are particularly relevant.\n\nUnit testing: we can test a trained model by checking if the data we‚Äôre working with in our production pipeline is compatible with the model we have trained during the Build phase. By testing with real data outside of that which was used to train the model, we‚Äôll get a better idea of whether outliers or strange data points return unexpected results from our trained model.\nIntegration testing: we can test how well the trained model behaves within the ecosystem of our product. For example, if the trained model is expecting data with a particular schema, does it parse it properly and return outcomes as expected based on the understanding of the model when we built it? In practice, this would look like a picture color recognition model erroring because one of the parameters it was accidentally passed was the date of origin. Containerization and microservices help make this possible (see Deployment below for details).\nPerformance/Stress testing: Much like in software engineering, we check the worst case scenario to test performance. For code we have the compilation time (which has become negligible in most cases) and big-O notation to connote computational complexity for runtime. In data science we use the training time and testing time as indicators. How does model training runtime compare to less greedy optimization methods? How does the model testing runtime compare to simpler models with fewer weights? The additional runtime of more complex models does not always translate to much better performance, and is sometimes not worth the large increase in runtime.\n\nDeploy\nOnce we have tested the trained model, we push it to production, similar to software engineering. There are many tools for deploying production code, all built around the ability to track changes with git commits. For data science projects, there is a huge void in deployment tools, as only the largest technology companies have the resources required to build proprietary in-house solutions. Datmo is building the platform and CLI that solves these problems specifically for data science and machine learning development. Drawing parallels to SWE, here are the key components\n\nVersion control : Datmo is like Git for data projects ‚Äî revert to prior models, share it with others, and compare results\nProvisioning microservices : Provision servers and containers specifically for the exact model you want to work with\nContinuous Integration : Prior to deployment, you can run the tests mentioned above to ensure the trained model works before pushing the microservice to production ‚Äî no interruption of service!\n\nLet‚Äôs see it in action\nHarry Potter Sorting Hat\nWe‚Äôll walk you through this process for a simple model ‚Äî a sorting hat! You will provide a selfie / picture of your face and the sorting hat will sort you into the appropriate Hogwarts house!\n\nPlan: We are going to build a model with a single image as an input and the output will be a set of 4 categories: Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. We will use a feature extractor on the image and port the result into a logistic regression classifier. Our training data will come from a set of images and houses of Harry Potter characters.\nBuild: We will use Python and Scikit-learn to implement our algorithm. Then we will run the training images through the feature extractor and train the classifier.\nTest: From the training test we will hold out a small subset and will test on that validation set during our training to validate it works. Then we will have a set of new images to see how they perform ‚Äî since I don‚Äôt know any wizards or have a real sorting hat to corroborate, I can‚Äôt provide a quantitative measure for my integration tests.\nDeploy: Create a prediction function that is translated to a simple RESTful API and deploy it locally on my server with an open port for others to access.\n\nIf you like what we‚Äôre doing at Datmo, show us some love by Clapping, sharing the story, and signing up for Datmo :)\nConcept Dependencies\n\n20170604-part-1-deploying-machine-learning-in-production\n"},"20180609-pushing-the-needle-forward-for-ai-deployments":{"title":"Pushing The Needle Forward For Ai Deployments","links":["20170915-learning-data-science-you-may-already-know-the-basics"],"tags":[],"content":"\nThis blog was originally posted on the Datmo Blog on June 9, 2018\n\nPushing the needle forward for AI deployments\nJune 9, 2018\nOriginal Link: medium.com/datmo/pushing-the-needle-forward-for-ai-deployments-633750c946be\nAt Datmo, we spend a lot of time working to build a better product for customers deploying AI to production, and part of that is ensuring that we are offering the most seamless developer experience possible. While each customer has a unique set of constraints between their model type and production needs, there is one thing consistent for everyone ‚Äî people want to spend less time on deployments, and more time working on their models and experiments.\nThis revelation is nothing particularly new. As explained in more detail by James Lindenbaum (Co-Founder of Heroku), more effective deployment/provisioning developer tools are a critical force multiplier in the fight to accelerate current software lifecycles.\nIn the recent history of modern software development, we‚Äôve seen vast improvements in efficiency for developers writing code, and despite great advances in generalized ops and deployment tools, deploying/provisioning have come to constitute an uncomfortably large portion of the model development lifecycle. This is due, in no small part, to a large number of unique problems AI deployments pose when compared to conventional software.\nWhen it comes to deployment of models, these unique difficulties are attributable to three major causes unique to models:\nFirst, is the tracking and reproduction of environments. When considering the number of model frameworks, language level packages, and system level (GPU/OS) drivers, compounded by compatibility issues for all of their respective versions, it becomes extremely difficult to track, standardize, and reproduce runtime environments.\nSecond, is the need to create a model interface (API) for serving requests, a process almost completely independent from the training that produced the model. To build a truly efficient inference system, a team would need to effectively master the intricacies of the underlying machine learning algorithms as well as the available deployment options.\nThird, is the differing number of deployment platforms and methods, all of which have their own respective setup and management pains. Similarly, while one deployment method may be optimal for one model, that won‚Äôt necessarily be the case for future models. However, in the status quo, each deployment method has its own learning curve, hindering companies from seamlessly switching between them.\nThe combination of these three factors creates an extremely large barrier to entry for performant and effective model deployment.\nAs a result of these complexities, there have been a startling number of system-level liabilities surfacing in the form of brittle glue code, unmanageable pipeline jungles, dead experimental code paths, improper abstraction debt, and more. In the face of these unique barriers, we see companies struggling to operationalize their first models, or realizing that their approach to continuously deploying models has become unscalable at the speed or breadth they require.\nTo us, the path forward is clear:\nCreate a tool that helps bring standardization, speed, and seamlessness to the AI deployment world.\nIn setting out to solve for the pain points of AI deployment, we‚Äôve optimized our tool, Datmo, around one concept that encapsulates the value we bring to developers ‚Äî minimizing Time to Deployment (TTD). Seen as the last mile problem in AI, we know that empowering data scientists and AI engineers to deploy and manage their models will close the development-deployment-iteration loop in a way that unlocks immense value for companies.\nTo show you this system, let‚Äôs talk about where deployment is today. The manual method of deployment is a long and arduous process. Even once you have your model code, there are still many operationalization steps that stand in the way of data scientists and using their model in production.\n\nInstall and write an API Wrapper for your model with a microframework (Falcon, Flask, Tornado, etc)\nPush your model + API code to a remote source (GitHub, Bitbucket, custom git repo, etc)\nProvision a server on cloud provider of choice\nSSH into a remote server\nPull code from the source remote to a remote server\nInstall GPU/system level utilities/drivers (if applicable)\nInstall project dependencies\nInstall the WSGI server framework (NGINX, Gunicorn, etc)\nInstantiate WSGI server pointed at API app\nPush process to the background for persistence, exit SSH\n\nOur first step in minimizing this long process was building datmo snapshots, the initial level of abstraction and the foundational building block for model deployment. We built snapshots to serve as a standalone record for the state of a given model‚Äôs code, files, data, metrics, and environments, which are all of the components necessary to reproduce your model elsewhere ‚Äî all unified within a single entity.\nSnapshots are extremely valuable and are the key to being able to log and reproduce your experiments (both locally and remotely), but after going through the process from the status quo and writing a blog post on converting models to a cloud API on AWS, we knew that there was more that could be done on the ‚Äúoperationalization‚Äù front.\nThis leads us to today:\nWith our datmo deployment CLI, we have abstracted resource (server/infrastructure) provisioning and model deployment into one simple command. No manual resource provisioning or server-side code meddling required, only a few local config files.\nIn fact, it‚Äôs so easy that you can do it in two minutes or less. See it in action here:\nFrom our experience, there are two optimal vectors for deployment ‚Äî a containerized microservice based solution, as well as a serverless based approach.\nFor containerized microservice deployments:\n\nAdd a one-line designator for denoting which function the API route should point to\nCreate a Dockerfile (handles system utilities, environments, and package installations)\n* Here‚Äôs an example of a Dockerfile that covers system-level utility and package installations that we‚Äôve made, feel free to customize it for your own use-cases!\n* Alternatively, here‚Äôs a handy guide to writing one from scratch, no Docker knowledge required!\nCreate a datmo configuration file (path to Dockerfile and model, as well as desired API route name)\nDatmo deploy command on CLI\n\nFor serverless deployments:\n\nAdd a one-line designator for denoting which function the API route should point to\nCreate a serverless deployment package\n* Here‚Äôs a guide to creating one for AWS Lambda, one of the most popular serverless deployment infrastructure choices.\nCreate a serverless datmo configuration file (path to Dockerfile and model, as well as desired API route name)\nDatmo deploy command on CLI\n\nOnce you‚Äôve chosen your method and followed those steps, you‚Äôre good to go! Datmo‚Äôs tool helps solve all of the provisioning, environment setup, and app deployment, based on your Dockerfile and configuration file. All you need to do is run `$ datmo deploy` and datmo will handle the rest.\nTime to Deployment benchmarks:\nFor Time to Deployment, we count the difference in time between when you‚Äôve hit deploy to the moment your API is live and queryable. Below are our baseline Time to Deployments from a cold start (no previously configured/provisioned resources) on AWS for both serverless (AWS Lambda) and containerized server deployments (on-demand EC2 instances).\nThere are two primary deployment types ‚Äî an initial deployment (which requires provisioning the infrastructure for the code to live on while it‚Äôs running), and updates/redeployments (which leverage existing infrastructure you‚Äôve provisioned already). Naturally, the initial deployment will take a little longer, but once that‚Äôs out of the way, redeploying new versions of your models is extremely fast.\nServerless deployments\nOne of the best parts about serverless applications on modern cloud platforms is infinite and instantaneous scalability, without having to think about the number of resources you‚Äôre provisioning. With one deploy command, datmo helps you reach this goal even faster.\nThe deployed serverless prediction code is available here, along with the additional serverless-specific config file.\nMicroservice cluster deployments (CPU)\nWhile a single deployment can seem very daunting, scaling an application out to a large number of servers is an even more difficult problem. Have no fear, because we‚Äôve designed datmo‚Äôs CLI to handle this with ease. With a parameter passed to the CLI at deploy time, datmo will automatically spin up a cluster with any number of servers, all without any additional legwork.\nThe full scikit-learn model source code is available here.\nMicroservice cluster deployments (GPU)\nModels leveraging GPU-powered prediction or training become even more difficult and time intensive to deploy than their CPU alternatives. However, the same set of steps enable you to achieve similar deployment times despite the added complexity that datmo is handling behind the scenes. Shown below are our results for a standard MXNet implementation of ResNet-152:\nMXNet model source code is taken from the official Apache tutorial, and available as-used in our tests here.\n*Note: Lambdas not possible for models of this size (memory limit) as well as GPU compatibility not existing for current cloud serverless implementations.*\nSummary\nTTD Comparison for Iris CPU Model across many servers\nRegardless of what a given model‚Äôs optimal deployment method is, datmo‚Äôs deployment tools can help you every step of the way ‚Äî from initial deployment to continuous deployment at scale.\nEnterprise-ready:\nIn short, we care a lot about how we can make the lives of data scientists and AI engineers better, and optimizing TTD is one of the biggest ways we have seen ourselves able to do that, offering a consistent and seamless experience whether you‚Äôre deploying your first model or your hundredth. And just as your needs grow over time, we‚Äôre confident to say we‚Äôre building for the future of the industry, to grow right alongside you by offering:\n- Decoupled serving architecture and model predictions by having a layered architecture for deployment, simplifying model packaging and deployment for the data scientist.\n- Caching, authentication, and scalability for deployed models with varying throughputs.\n- Support for a concurrent serving of multiple models, using any number of AI frameworks or cloud providers.\nWe know that when it comes to the enterprise stage, the process of deployment isn‚Äôt binary ‚Äî there‚Äôs so much more involved. That‚Äôs why all of our benchmarks are run on our turn-key enterprise solution, where each deployment comes out of the box with:\n* Job queueing (microservice deployment method)\n* Task scheduling\n* REST API/stream/batch request building\n* Environment image reproducibility (containerization)\n* App initialization\n* Request load balancing\nWe sweat the small details because we know from firsthand experience that an AI pipeline is only as strong as its‚Äô weakest link, and business value can only be accessed if the entire system works like a well-oiled machine from end to end.

Is that truly achievable in a society that values money, fame, and power over all else? As Hasan Minhaj‚Äôs uncle once said\n\nCapitalism is built upon the fundamentals of meritocratic ascension but defines ascension through the root word capital. If you can make more money, you ascend, but those principles often do not incentivize doing good, only doing well.\n\n_ In this series, we are going to challenge this myth by highlighting the companies doing both successfully._\n\nWhat Does _ ‚ÄúDoing Good‚Äù_ Mean?\nBefore we dive into the concept, let‚Äôs first define what we mean by Doing Good in the context of businesses _ ._ Certainly it means different things to different people. In the personal sense, often we say we are Doing Good when we are helping others, and Doing Well when we are helping ourselves. For businesses, that same concept is a good start, though is a bit limited.\nHere, we will categorize Doing Good for businesses by looking at 2 key questions:\n\n\nWhat type of problem does it solve? Are these large scale challenges that are global in nature? Does it help improve access or quality of basic physiological and safety needs as defined by Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy? Examples include: Rapid population growth, increased climate related risks, widespread poverty, increased infectious disease spread, socioeconomic inequity, widespread hunger, among others.\n\n\nWho is the end beneficiary? : Does it disproportionately, though not necessarily solely, help vulnerable populations? Examples include: the poor, old, sick, less fortunate, etc\n\n\nWho is ‚Äú _ Doing Good‚Äù_ ?\n_ Doing Good_ is something that both nonprofit and for-profit organizations are pursuing, yet their approaches are often very different.\nNonprofits are typically built to serve a social mission. Their key premise is to serve people first and reinvest their profits back into serving their key demographic. These can be created by wealthy individuals (e.g. Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates, Marc Benioff), grassroots organizations, or inspired groups backed by grants and donations and are driven to, first and foremost, solve the social challenge nearest and dearest to their hearts. Doing Good is a key tenet of nonprofits by their very nature and is a key driver of success. Yet nonprofits are often highly dependent on funding and donations which makes them vulnerable to market swings and other macroeconomic events putting their long-term growth and overall sustainability as a business at risk.\nFor-profit companies on the other hand, are built to turn a profit first and foremost, regardless of the industry they are in. That said, big or small, most for-profit companies today have also accepted that Doing Good is good business and represent a trend toward ‚ÄúConscientious Capitalism‚Äù because of 3 main reasons:\n\n\nGlobal challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, poverty, among many others, pose serious risks to many businesses.\n\n\nEmployees want to work for a more socially conscious employer.\n\n\nCustomers want to buy from a more socially aware brand.\n\n\n_ Doing Good_ for many for-profit companies ends up being a net positive on many fronts that contribute to a more sustainable and long-lasting business. The model we often see of Doing Good is some combination of charitable donations to nonprofits or investment in social missions that are often not directly tied to their core business. Most behemoth for-profit companies today, for example, have social good arms that focus on ESG (Environment, Social, Governance considerations) and broader social problems, from companies as traditional as BP and Procter &amp; Gamble, to tech giants like Amazon and Netflix. A particularly creative example of this is the Pledge 1% movement, where for-profit companies big and small, investors, and people are encouraged to pledge 1% of their time, profit, product, carry or equity towards the causes they care about most. This enables companies of all sizes to participate in Doing Good , even before they generate significant profits.\nFor the for-profit companies above, these charitable donations typically, and often explicitly (e.g. Pledge 1%) are a small fraction of their overall earnings or profits, leaving a lot more room and potential to make an even larger difference.\n\nIn this series, we are NOT going to focus on the companies above but rather on a special group of for-profit companies who unlock their full potential for Doing Good by providing products and services whose core value directly solves some of these hairy global challenges.\nWhat is ‚Äú _ Doing Well by Doing Good‚Äù?_\n\n_ Doing Well by Doing Good is a concept characterized by for-profit companies that creatively tie in capital incentives through products and services that directly feed into immediate good for society from Day 1. These companies are a subset of those described above, but are differentiated by their ability to tie closer to 100% of their operating revenue to contribute towards Doing Good rather than a fraction like many of the other companies mentioned above._\n\nWe live in a particularly special time where _ Doing Good_ is widely accessible to for-profit companies small and large. Yet _ Doing Well by Doing Good_ , where your output directly contributes to societal impact is difficult because it means everything from your product, your service, your employees, your mission, and everything in between is built to solve pressing problems and help vulnerable people. Of course, as a for-profit business, profit goes back to investors and shareholders, but because the company offers a product or service which helps contribute to solving a fundamental societal challenge, it has tangibly contributed to making a difference just by conducting its daily business. Whether times are good or bad, if these companies are able to build a robust business, they can continue to sustain their societal impact.\nThe fundamental question then remains, which companies exhibit this lofty ideal? Is it really possible to achieve a high-margin, high-growth business, that delivers social impact and fulfills a similar societal role as a nonprofit? Is Doing Well by Doing Good possible?\nThankfully, despite the difficulty, Doing Well by Doing Good has become more common and is embodied by a number of startups spanning the spectrum from healthcare, finance, tech, to energy and beyond.\nWho is ‚Äú _ Doing Well by Doing Good‚Äù_ ?\nThe companies who exhibit this pattern are unique because they embody the basic principles of capitalism but exercise an evolved form of it. While the concept of making a quick buck and building sustainable businesses is still a key tenet of their startup ethos, these companies define missions and build products and services that bind their core values of doing good with their profit-driven goals right from the start proving that growth can go hand-in-hand with positive impact. In other words, these companies have the direct impact of a nonprofit, with the DNA of a for-profit.\nCOVID-19: Startups Seizing the Opportunity\nGiven we are all stuck in our own homes quarantining in the best way we know how, it has become clear that the world has changed. The world is going through one of the largest natural experiments and we are experiencing it in real time. If nothing else, this has revealed something amazing, that the world can come together to solve hard problems.\nIn this first post of the series, I wanted to address the COVID-19 situation to highlight some key Doing Well by Doing Good for-profit startups that are rising to the occasion to make a difference and improve their business while staying true (and in many cases even truer) to their mission in the process.\n\nRide Health\n\nRide Health is a healthtech company streamlining transportation logistics for patients and healthcare workers, and they are bridging the gap by doing good through ‚ÄúSmarter transportation for every patient need‚Äù and doing well by building a profit-making business through partnerships.\nDuring this time of crisis, Ride Health is finding ways to further both goals by expanding their transport network to help deliver food to the most vulnerable patients, transport healthcare personnel to the hospital, and keep everyone safe through PPE and advanced contact tracing and alerts within their network of hospitals. Once again, by staying true to their mission, they are driving better immediate impact, positive outcomes for healthcare providers, and overall goodwill with their customers.\n\nBiobot\n\nBiobot is a healthtech company with a mission ‚Äúto transform wastewater infrastructure into public health observatories.‚Äù Biobot tests sewage to provide better public health info to decision makers, and helps ensure equal representation in public health records to enable more balanced decision-making while creating a for-profit business through partnerships.\nBiobot is working on a pro-bono initiative to test sewage for COVID-19 to better provide data to public health officials given the lack of testing currently available to people. This initiative helps to test their technology, provide better data granularity to their customers, and boosts customer confidence.\n\nNova Credit\n\nNova Credit is a fintech company which enables U.S. immigrants to transfer over their credit history from their home country with a mission ‚Äúto inspire and facilitate the flow of human diversity‚Äù. Nova Credit has a Doing Well by Doing Good ethos and mission, by tying revenue growth to the direct benefit they provide to immigrant populations seeking financial freedom in the US.\nIn response to COVID-19, Nova Credit has taken an active role along with a number of business owners and investors to write a letter directly to representatives requesting visa deadline extensions for immigrants. In addition, they have continued to compile helpful resources to enable immigrants better navigate government restrictions. These efforts benefit the immigrants who rely on Nova Credit‚Äôs service, their employees, and the clients and partners with whom they work enabling increased usage and referrals, while providing a valuable service to an immigrant community dependent upon credit to survive. This response is not only true to their mission, but a revenue driver which directly correlates to improving financial outcomes for immigrant communities.\n\nTrying times have a way of breeding the best, most sustainable companies, because it forces companies to adapt to times. What‚Äôs exciting is that COVID-19 is showing that these special Doing Well by Doing Good startups are no different, in fact, their evolved capitalism may be the most resilient business model out there.\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\nIn this joint Blog and Podcast series, we will highlight and interview for-profit private companies like those above at various stages and from multiple industries whose core existence embodies Doing Well by Doing Good. Each episode will highlight a single company and their key characteristics, missions, and methods to achieve both a profitable business and affect societal change.\nLooking forward to sharing this journey with you and learning together how these innovative companies are adapting and making their positive impact on the world today.\n\nIf you know of any companies that are _ Doing Well by Doing Good_ and think they should be highlighted, please contact us at hello@doingwellbydoinggood.co\nStay up to date with updates on our subsequent posts and podcasts by subscribing to our Substack page @ dwdg.substack.com"},"20200606-profitable-with-a-purpose-":{"title":"Profitable with a Purpose üåü","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Original Link: thegoodaipod.substack.com/p/profitable-with-a-purpose-\nProfitable with a Purpose üåü\nJun 06, 2020\n_üëãüèΩ Welcome toDoing Well by Doing Good: The New Startup Model, a newsletter highlighting the startups that are profitable with a purpose. _\nHere we highlight the startups, small or large, that are driving global societal change and a sustainable business model through the products and services they provide‚Äîin other words, the startups that are profitable with a purpose.\n\nIn the newsletter we‚Äôll keep you up-to-date on the latest companies that fit the bill through interviews with founders, digests on the latest company being funded, and insights on what makes these companies successful.\nWhy Start This?\nThere are a lot of blogs and newsletters about startups doing good, but not many that keep up-to-date on the latests startups that tie their profit-driven incentives to contributing to change in society.

But one problem that spans all of these worldwide is inequality and unequal access.\nIn the US today, Juneteenth, commemorates the celebration of June 19, 1865 ‚Äî the day all slaves were finally freed within the US. But it‚Äôs also a day to reflect on the remaining inequalities we still have here in the US and around the world.\n\nIn recent weeks the BLM protests sparked by the murder of yet another innocent Black person, George Floyd, have called attention to the ongoing inequality in the treatment of the Black community.\nThis movement, sparked by the police brutality and the broken criminal justice system in the US, is only one of the many systemic inequalities experienced daily by the Black community around the world.\n\nIn the fight for Equality , individuals and companies both have their role to play\nIndividuals play a key role in changing governmental systems which perpetuate these inequities and we can all do our part to chip in. Here are a few links I found helpful:\n\n\nGreat blog post on how to be an ally is a great starting point\n\n\nThe Black Lives Matter website has the latest info which you can subscribe to for continual updates on ways to help\n\n\nCompanies play a key role through their actions and words. Global companies from Google to Johnson &amp; Johnson and everyone in between are taking a stand and doing their part to support the movement through words, money, and action.\nIn this post I wanted to highlight a few growing for-profit startups who are fighting for a more level playing field every day and are taking a stand to create a more equitable world directly through the products and services they provide.\n\nFor each company, I‚Äôll keep it simple by focusing on just 4 things: mission, product / service , doing well ( how they make money ) , and doing good ( how they contribute to equalizing the playing field ).\n\nAndela\nAndela is well-funded VC-backed startup focused on building a better remote engineering team experience. They train world class engineering talent from Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Egypt, and Ghana and provide them opportunities to contribute to remote engineering teams all over the world.\n\nMission: Solving the global tech talent shortage through training and job opportunities for engineers from Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Egypt and Ghana.\nProduct / Service : End-to-end remote engineering management and training process to help development teams within companies deliver great products.\nDoing Well : Andela makes money by charging between 50,000 to 120,000 per developer, passing on about a third of that to the developer and utilizing the rest to support company operations. Each developer hired and new project delivered means more access for the developers.\nDoing Good : Andela provides training and development services to aspiring developers in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Egypt, and Ghana. This levels the playing field and barrier to entry for African engineers into the global technology ecosystem.\ntEQuitable\ntEQuitable is a seed stage startup founded in 2017 and backed by Y Combinator focused on building an equitable workplace through their platform. As mentioned on their website, they are a tech-enabled Ombuds practice focused on arbitrating issues of bias, discrimination, or harassment in the workplace.\n\nMission : Help companies be more inclusive and create a work culture that works for everyone\nProduct / Service : Platform to create a more equitable workplace by addressing issues of bias, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace\nDoing Well: Employers‚Äô HR departments purchase a subscription to the platform. As more and larger companies adopt the platform their revenue grows along with their ability to affect more and more individuals.\nDoing Good : Bias, discrimination and harassment disproportionately affect minority populations within the workforce. By contributing to alleviating these challenges, tEQuitable creates a more welcoming and inclusive workplace.\nValence\nValence Community is a seed stage global social network for Black professionals founded in 2019 and growing rapidly. They are creating a global network of professionals with many of the same advantages of LinkedIn and GirlBoss, but with an additional key focus on highlighting the successful Black business executives and professionals to inspire the next generation.\n\nMission : Unlock the global combined power of Black professionals to create massive economic and social progress\nProduct / Service : Professional social network for the Black professionals to connect, network, find mentors, and jobs.\nDoing Well : This community has multiple ways to make money as the network grows through paid ads, job posting, and value added subscriptions. While that may not be the main focus currently, it‚Äôs clear that as the network grows, monetization grows commensurate with the ability to do good.\nDoing Good : This network provides access to a traditionally underrepresented minority in professional circles to mentorship, jobs, and networking opportunities, helping to bridge the gap in representation. In fact, their website even mentions their key value to ‚Äúclose the racial wealth gap‚Äù.\n\nEquality cannot be solved in an instant, but startups are constantly finding new ways to solve tough global challenges like this and for-profit DWDG startups are one of the most scalable ways to do it.

From Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank to Ben &amp; Jerry‚Äôs. Social Enterprise is best defined by the Social Enterprise Alliance as\n\nOrganizations that address a basic unmet need or solve a social or environmental problem through a market-driven approach.\n\nI love this definition ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear and direct and covers global organizations, institutions and everyone in between. But how do the high-growth and high-impact Doing Well by Doing Good startups fit into this definition?\n\nAs a quick reminder, our definition of companies Doing Well by Doing Good is defined as below in our introductory post.\n\nDoing Well by Doing Good is a concept characterized by for-profit companies that creatively tie in capital incentives through products and services that directly feed into immediate good for society from Day 1. These companies are differentiated by their ability to tie close to 100% of their operating revenue to contribute towards Doing Good rather than a fraction like many other companies.\n\nIn this post we want to address the question: Aren‚Äôt Social Enterprises just companies that are Doing Well by Doing Good? What‚Äôs the difference? Let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper.\n\nBreakdown of Social Enterprises\nSocial Enterprises can be nonprofit or for-profit and span 3 different categories according to the Social Enterprise Alliance:\n\n\n\n_ Opportunity Employment : organizations that employ people who have significant barriers to mainstream employment. [Examples include Goodwill Industries , Greyston Bakery &amp; Nisolo.]_\n\n\n_ Transformative Products or Services: organizations that create social or environmental impact through innovative products and services. [Examples include Benetech , Growing Sound &amp; Soles4Souls.]_\n\n\n_ Donate Back: organizations that contribute a portion of their profits to nonprofits that address basic unmet needs. [Examples include Everly , The Thx Co. &amp;Songs Against Slavery.]_\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down one-by-one (zoom over to the TLDR; if you want the key conclusions.\n\nOpportunity Employment as defined and evidenced by examples above, covers for-profit and nonprofit entities. The examples of opportunity employment focused organizations abound; another example is the Delancey Street Foundation, which provides opportunities to ‚Äúsubstance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom‚Äù. This definition can also expand to initiatives run by large Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Diversity &amp; Inclusion commitments like Microsoft‚Äôs for the disabled). While a number of Doing Well by Doing Good companies will inevitably have such policies, it often isn‚Äôt the sole motivator or driver of their business.\n\n\n2. Transformative Products &amp; Services are exactly the kinds of companies that we talk about here. Companies that deliver products and services that create social or environmental impact, can tie nearly 100% of their revenue generation to the impact their create. While the examples above cover both nonprofit (Soles4Souls, Benetech) and for-profit (Growing Sound) companies, our focus for _Doing Well by Doing Good_ on the high-growth for-profit companies that deliver these products and services and aim to scale them globally.\n\n3. Donate Back is the tried and true method of Doing Good. It is one of the key methods that companies, from large Fortune 500s to small businesses, contribute to the causes they care about most. Movements like the Pledge 1% **** are a good way to do this, where companies pledge 1% of time or money to nonprofits directly creating societal and environmental impact. These methods broadly, much like the Pledge 1% movement, often contribute only a fraction of organizations‚Äô profits or revenues. Doing Well by Doing Good companies might do some of these activities because of their ethos and character through company initiatives, but do not use this as their primary means of making a difference.\n\n\nTLDR;\n\n_ Doing Well by Doing Good_ companies, by definition, are for-profit Social Enterprises run by Social Entrepreneurs because they build transformative products and services that directly contribute to global societal and environmental change.\n\n\nSocial Enterprises are a superset of all companies Doing Well by Doing Good, and there are a number of them that are local, nonprofit, and contributing to change in their own way. These companies contribute to very real change and do it through a number of different means. In short, there is no way that is better than another in creating positive change‚Äîeach has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nHowever, in this series, we continue to explore how and why the Doing Well by Doing Good approach is a faster, more sustainable and more impactful way to create positive global societal and environmental change ‚Äî or in other words\n\nUntil next time,\nAnand"},"20200719-fixing-the-broken-us-immigration":{"title":"üõ†Ô∏è Fixing the Broken US Immigration System üá∫üá∏","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Original Link: thegoodaipod.substack.com/p/-fixing-the-broken-us-immigration\nüõ†Ô∏è Fixing the Broken US Immigration System üá∫üá∏\nShould startups run the government?\nJul 19, 2020\nüëãüèΩ Welcome to Doing Well by Doing Good: The New Startup Model, a newsletter highlighting the startups aiming to be profitable with a purpose.\nIf you‚Äôre not already subscribed, please consider subscribing below or sharing with a friend. Thanks üòÄ\n Sign up for the newsletter\n\nImmigration is a hot topic nowadays, and for good reason. In just the last week there has been a whirlwind of news:\n\n\nThe Trump administration scaled back rules on foreign student visas requiring in-person classes to proceed\n\n\nFederal judge ordered the Trump administration to continue accepting DACA applications after ruling the program was improperly canceled in June \n\n\nReport finds immigration officials did not follow guidelines for providing migrant children healthcare \n\n\nIt goes without saying that even in just the last few weeks, immigrants to the US have been thrown for a loop, with constant changes in policy and enforcement.\n\nIn this post, we explore what‚Äôs broken in the US immigration system, suggested policies to fix it, and the startups that are finding ways to fix this problem from the outside.\nDoing Well by Doing Good startups play a couple of key roles in the narrative of immigration and in this post we‚Äôll address two of these key roles\n\n\nDoing Well by Doing Good startups are some of the most creative and innovative startups out there, tying capital incentives directly to doing good for society. These require out-of-the-box thinking, diverse teams, and oftentimes legislation to support their missions. The broken US immigration system puts these companies, their founders and employees, equally, if not more more, at risk than other companies\n\n\nImmigrants are also some of the most vulnerable populations within the US. So by definition, any for-profit company helping solve this challenging problem fits the Doing Well by Doing Good criteria.\n\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs dig into some numbers about immigration\n\nData Shows‚Ä¶Immigrants Get the Job Done\nIt has been proven time and time again that immigrants, across all socioeconomic backgrounds, are a larger driver of economic growth than US citizens alone. Immigrants are mobile, contribute to filling job shortages, work in highly critical national security fields, and the list goes on. Most critical is that immigrants contribute to job growth via entrepreneurship ‚Äî in fact 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by 1st or 2nd generation immigrants.\n\nIn a recent article on Immigration Policy Levers for US Innovation and Startups published in April by the HBS Professor William R. Kerr and Wellesley Economist Sari Pekkala Kerr, they explored the current challenges in our current Visa-based system and a few solutions to the problem. The abstract starts with perhaps the most telling statement\n\n_Immigrants account for about a quarter of US invention and entrepreneurship despite a policy environment that is not well suited for these purpose_s\n\n\nIn other words, immigrants drive economic growth through innovation and entrepreneurship by overcoming these barriers , but this broken policy environment is HINDERING the full potential of immigration.\nWhat‚Äôs Broken?\nIn the paper, Kerr identifies 4 key problems with the current system\n\nH1B visa limits are too low to meet demand and EB residency is distributed with a 7% cap for each country, not accounting for population adjustment for larger countries (e.g. China and India)\n\n\n\nCurrent H1B lottery systems provide equal weight is given to basic skills vs. specialized skills. Kerr explains this with an example of the H1B lottery system in software.\n\n\nIndeed, the lottery system likely even tilts the application pool further towards more mundane uses: it is easier for a company to submit multiple applications for a routine software developer role, knowing that the overall odds per applicant are in the range of 40%, than it is for a company to submit multiple applications for a scarce skillset like artificial intelligence research. (In a comparable way, it is likely that the lottery favors large companies submitting many H-1B applications over smaller companies who have more discrete needs.)\n\n\n\nUS universities do not face any cap on student visas while US companies do, leaving many students unsure of their status after graduation. The OPT program provides 1-3 years to students, but the uncertainty of receiving permanent residency always exists.\n\n\nGreen cards are heavily skewed towards family reunification (68% of green cards in 2016) rather than employment-based green cards (only 12% in 2016), leading to large backlogs of green card applications for employed immigrants.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no special visas or incentives for immigrants to start businesses. Immigrants who do start companies have to choose from an imperfect set of visas.\n\nDespite the data showing that US immigration creates jobs at a higher rate than it takes jobs, inefficient government policies remain, often because political expediency wins out over what‚Äôs economically most effective and equitable.\nBUT there is a way forward‚Ä¶\n\nHow Can Policy Fix it?\nKerr suggested a few solutions to each of these problems. While these are just suggestions, some of them have been proposed for quite some time‚Ä¶with little progress.\n\n\nIncrease the number of H1B visas available annually to spur growth and increase the expected value of innovative companies\n\n\nTo address the H1B lottery inefficiencies, Kerr suggests a few options to fix this\n\n\n*  **Remove the lottery system and instead rank candidates by the wage and compensation their employers are offering**\n\n*  **Same as above, with an additional minimum wage requirement (e.g. $100,000)**\n\n*  **Remove the lottery system, and auction visas to companies (the primary driver of sponsorships for H1B applications)**\n\n3.  Transitioning from student visas to work visas results in significant drop off. Kerr suggests a few options to fix this:\n*  **Provide 3-5 years of work visa automatically after school (as is already provided in some countries)**\n\n*  **‚ÄúStaple‚Äù a green card to any advanced STEM degree**\n\n4.  Kerr suggests a reallocation of green cards to shift to higher percentage of ‚Äúemployment-based‚Äù green cards\n\nAs the key topic of the essay, Kerr suggested a few options to address the ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship Visa‚Äù which have currently been put to the floor and discussed quite extensively\n\n*  _ **In 2019, the &quot;Startup Act&quot;, ‚Ä¶introduced on a bipartisan basis within the Senate‚Ä¶sought to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue up to 75,000 &quot;conditional immigrant&quot; visas to entrepreneurs who register a new business, employ at least two full-time employees, and invest or raise at least $100,000 in the business within the first year. For the following three years, entrepreneurs would be required to employ an average of at least five full-time employees in order to remove the conditional basis of their visa.**_\n\n*  _ **The new EB-2 NIW (national interest waiter) stipulates : &quot;(1) that the foreign nationals proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance; (2) that the foreign national is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor; and (3) that, on balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification.‚Äù**_\n\n*  _ **In January 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Obama Administration published the International Entrepreneur Rule, a rule permitting the DHS to extend a discretionary grant of parole lasting up to 30 months (2.5 years) to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs must (1) possess at least 10 percent ownership interest in startup created within the last five years, (2) have an active and central role in the operations and future growth of the entity, (3) have secured a minimum of $100,000 from government grants or at least $250,000 from a qualified US investor for the business, and (4) demonstrate evidence of substantial potential for rapid business growth or job creation. This was eliminated in May 2018**_\n\nThe policies explained by Kerr are a good place to start, but like any policy they take a long time to see the light of day, and in many cases have failed multiple times in committee.\n\nThankfully, much like the innovation that these pro-immigration policies themselves promote, startups are finding ways to fix this problem outside of the confines of policy.\n\nDWDG Startups Fixing the System from the Outside\nGetting creative when the deck is stacked against you is perhaps the most immigrant trait around. Unsurprisingly these Doing Well by Doing Good startups are facing the challenge head-on.\n\nBoundless Immigration\n**Boundless Immigration is a Seattle-basedSeries A company founded in 2017 to help immigrants better navigate the complex US immigration system. **\n\nMission : Empowering families to navigate the immigration system more confidently, rapidly, and affordably.\nProduct / Service: Boundless provides a software as a service offering for immigrants looking to file for a marriage green cards as well as applications for US citizenship.

But while the AI hype continues, the applications are slowly becoming more and more practical\n\nUsing AI to Do Well by Doing Good\nAI [or ML , or Statistics with Compute Power , whatever you call it] is a topic near and dear to my own heart because I practice it daily, and time and time again, it proves to be an enabling technology that has the potential to disrupt every industry, much like seminal technologies like smartphones , the internet , telephones , or of course our favorite‚Ä¶\n\nBut‚Ä¶this often misses the point. AI is NOT a cure-all for every problem. Let‚Äôs not forget that 13% of the world still doesn‚Äôt have access to actual electricityand 40% doesn‚Äôt have access to clean cooking fuels. There are still some serious global problems that need to be solved and AI, along with other emerging technologies, have the potential to both make it better or worse.\n\nSo how is AI being used as a force for Doing Good today? The nonprofit organization AI 4 Good organization puts it best ‚Äî\n\n_To date, the unbalanced nature of incentives and funding for Artificial Intelligence research has favored commercial applications , such as defense and advertising, at the expense of altruistic applications. Artificial Intelligence research must be applied beyond these sectors ‚Äî to help solve social, economic, and environmental problems ‚Äî if it will benefit society to the fullest extent possible. _\n\nIt‚Äôs true that AI has been used first where large checks and a tech-forward mindset converge leaving the socioeconomic divide, environmental destruction, and other global challenges as far seconds.\n\nAt the same time ‚ÄúAI for Social Good‚Äù initiatives are becoming more and more popular at Google, Facebook, and as a talking point for recommendations by McKinsey, BCG, and blogs all over the internet.\nBut what if AI companies build in capital incentives to solve these challenges today?\nIn this post, we identify the AI startups [defined as companies where AI is core to enabling their product] that are merging commercial **** applications with solving social, economic, and environmental challenges. In other words ‚Äî Doing Well by Doing Good.\n\n\nBinah.AI\nBinah.AI is a Series B healthtech company focused on bringing healthcare analytics to everyone, bridging the social divide through data. AI is used to measure key vitals directly from a smartphone camera removing the need for expensive wearables.\n\nMission: Removing the missing link in digital healthcare. Enhancing personal wellness. Today.\nProduct / Service: An SDK which uses AI-based video analysis technology to identify a number of vital signs using just a smartphone camera as well as an enterprise offering for employers to monitor employee health.\nDoing Well: Sells subscriptions to either its platform or SDK offering to enterprises who then make it available to individuals.\nDoing Good: Through its customers, Binah enables digital healthcare to be accessed by anyone removing the need for expensive wearables and accessories. With only a smartphone (nearly 3.5B smartphone users globally), basic vitals previously unavailable, are made available to individuals and healthcare professionals.\nOne Concern\nOne Concern is Series B climate tech company focused on solving global planetary resilience through innovative technology solution. AI is used to enable new rapid and dynamic measurement of resilience, which previously has only been done through more static physics-based approaches.\n\nMission: To build resilience before, during, and after a natural disaster.\nProduct / Service: Software for governments, enterprises, and financial services to better respond to and prepare for natural disasters.\nDoing Well: Revenue is generated through subscriptions to a SaaS platform.\nDoing Good: Each subscription sold, improves the customer‚Äôs ability to build a resilient business, community, or financial structure. For governments, this directly saves lives, for businesses, it saves livelihoods, and for financial services it funds resilience and recovery efforts to help communities and businesses continue to function.\nSkillLab\nSkillLab is an early stage startup based in the EU, using AI to better match refugees to available education and employment opportunities.\n\nMission : EMPOWERING JOB SEEKERS. We believe that no person should be excluded from opportunity simply because their skills are invisible. That is why we help people express their skills and uncover pathways to social and economic participation.\nProduct / Service : An application using AI to match employment and educational services to individuals to provide personal career orientation at scale.\nDoing Well : SkillLab makes money by partnering with enterprises looking for labor or organizations looking to train and educate future members of the workforce.\nDoing Good : Refugees in the EU are some of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to the labor market. SkillLab is focused on helping the refugee segment launch their career in a new country by using AI-enabled matching algorithms to recommend education and employment opportunities, thereby enabling better social and economic participation within the EU.\n\nAI startups have been a fad for the last 5-10 years, and have become an easy way to raise money for everything from sales tools, to improved ad targeting. As the technology progresses and moves from quick wins (e.g. AI poetry üòõ) to lasting change , more and more for-profit AI Social Enterprises are coming out of the woodwork and finding ways to Do Well by Doing Good, and we‚Äôll keep you posted as they happen.\nI‚Äôll leave you with an optimistic quote which hopefully holds true over the coming years.\n\n‚ÄúThe coming era of Artificial Intelligence will not be the era of war, but be the era of deep compassion, non-violence, and love.‚Äù - Amit Ray, founder of the Compassionate AI Movement\n\nAs always, thanks for the reading and if you know of any startups that are Doing Well by Doing Good, always looking forward to chatting.\n\nLoyal Subject to our Robot Overlords,\nAnand"},"20200812-nova-credit-ceo-misha-esipov-on-financial-inclusion-for-immigrants":{"title":"üéôÔ∏è¬† Nova Credit CEO Misha Esipov on Financial Inclusion for Immigrants","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"original link: thegoodaipod.substack.com/p/-podcast-with-nova-credit-ceo-misha\nüéôÔ∏è¬† Nova Credit CEO Misha Esipov on Financial Inclusion for Immigrants\nAugust 12, 2020\nüëãüèΩ Welcome to Doing Well by Doing Good: The New Startup Model, a newsletter and podcast series highlighting the startups aiming to be profitable with a purpose.\n\nWelcome to our first podcast post! We‚Äôre excited to share it with you and get your feedback üòÄ. We recently had the chance to chat with Series B startup Nova Credit Co-founder &amp; CEO Misha Esipov about financial inclusion for immigrants (screenshot of their website below for reference).\n\nIn this podcast we talk about how Nova Credit got started , it‚Äôs mission and culture , and how it balancesDoing Well while Doing Good. Misha also gives us a glimpse into how he and his co-founders decided to build a for-profit social enterprise , and some advice he has to would-be entrepreneurs and job seekers looking to make a difference.\n\nFounding Story\nAnand [0:36] : All right. Welcome, Misha. Thank you for taking the time.\nMisha [0:39] : My pleasure. Good to see you again.\nAnand [0:44] : So why don‚Äôt we get started? Could you describe Nova credit in one line?\nMisha [0:50] : One line, it‚Äôs never easy. Nova credit is a global credit bureau that helps newcomers and could access to the financial services that they need? That‚Äôs one line. I can add a second, if you‚Äôd like. Let me pause there in case you‚Äôve got it.\nAnand [1:06] : Please add a second line.\nMisha [1:08] : Yeah, I mean the underlying problem for those listening that haven‚Äôt heard of us before, is when you first moved to the US from abroad and apply for a financial product of any sort of credit card and auto loan or mortgage, you need to have credit history. And when you first moved to the US, you have no credit history or what‚Äôs called a no hit or a thin file or a No file. And what we do is we solve that problem of enabling people to build up credit history by using their foreign credit history. And I can share a little bit more about how we do that a bit later.\nAnand [1:43] : Got it. That sounds great. That‚Äôs a great, great start. And honestly, this is why we wanted to talk because I think Nova Credit is certainly Doing Well by Doing Good. So I thought that we could start with a background. So what was your founding journey? How did you get here?\nMisha [2:01] : So Nova started actually as a class project at Stanford, back in 2016. We were grad students interested in financial services more broadly. And we were interviewing classmates and friends and anybody who would give us any time about their experience with finance and asking very basic questions around, you know, do you have a credit card? How did you make the decision for that credit? How did you decide which credit card to go for? Do you have a student loan? Did you make that decision? What‚Äôs the rate and very quickly, we realized that half of the people we were speaking with were foreign, and 100% of that half would share the same narrative of, I can‚Äôt get a credit card, I can‚Äôt get an auto loan, I can‚Äôt get a student loan. I have to go beg my classmate to put me on their family plan at T-Mobile or wherever. And it was just very, very clear that there was a real burning need for a group of people for a very niche segment of the US population that we thought we could solve. And so the underlying problem, as I alluded to earlier is that when you first come to the US, you don‚Äôt have any US credit history. And so we then set out and now spent the better part of four years solving that problem by enabling people to access their own credit history from their home country. So let‚Äôs say you move to the states from Canada, or Mexico or India or UK, we go out and we access your credit history in your home country. And we will instantly translate that information into what we call a Credit Passport. And a Credit Passport or the spirit of it is the same way that a passport is how you travel the world and enter into a new country. Your Credit Passport is how you access financial services, globally. And so we will then take that information, transform it into a new format in the US and deliver that to support your eligibility for a product in the US. So the user experiences is I want to get an American Express card as an example, or a student loan, I‚Äôll go and apply for those products online. Once the lender determines that you don‚Äôt have enough US credit history, we emerge in that user journey. And we‚Äôll go and pull your history with your consent from your home country and deliver that to somebody like American Express. And by doing so, increase the likelihood of your ability to get approved.\nAnand [4:22] : That‚Äôs awesome. So then the user is as an immigrant, they‚Äôre able to access financial services that they couldn‚Äôt otherwise. And in your case, or in the Nova Credit case, what you‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôre actually coming in when they realize they can‚Äôt access that service.\nMisha [4:36] : You got it. And we come in not on a direct-to-consumer basis, we come in through the enterprise. So a consumer who has chosen to apply for a product, we can actually go and support their ability to get access to that product in real time. And the founding journey was one I sort of danced around that a little bit. The founding journey is really one of realizing there was a real problem when you go on here. We spoke probably with 150 to 200 classmates and friends and did a ton of user research and interviewing. And it just became really clear that immigration is an incredibly vulnerable period of transition where you have to, obviously relocate, most likely learn a new language, potentially retrain yourself professionally. And when you do that, you also are moving into a world where you don‚Äôt have the same social safety net that you had in your home country. In your home country, if something goes wrong, you‚Äôve got a network, you‚Äôve got family, people to lean on who can support you, but in the US if something goes wrong, or if you need access to to finance you can only really rely on US banks. And those banks aren‚Äôt able or historically have not been able to serve you because they don‚Äôt know who you are. And so we identified this data problem, which ultimately Nova Credit solves, as an information asymmetry that exists and Nova Credit has built the infrastructure that solves that hole.\n\nMission &amp; Culture\nAnand [6:07] : That makes sense. This is very interesting founding story and I‚Äôm sure there were many ups and downs along the way as well. I‚Äôm curious about your mission. So what is your company mission? And how do you create a culture everyday that embodies it?\nMisha [6:27] : Yeah, our mission as a business is to inspire and facilitate the flow of human diversity and what that means is we don‚Äôt believe in diversity for simply the sake of diversity. We believe in diversity because we believe it creates a better world, a richer culture, and a more exciting world to to be a part of. Obviously, diversity is a very big topic right now, with everything going on in the world. And we‚Äôve really put diversity at the center of our mission from the very beginning. I mean, core business has been focused on diversity of people from around the world. But over time, we see this mission as an opportunity to expand beyond the immigrant and the newcomer segment and really starting to focus on economic mobility and economic diversity and helping people rise up across the US economy. In terms of creating a culture that embodies a mission, it‚Äôs really about being very deliberate and creating company rituals. So I‚Äôll give you an example or a few examples. At every all hands since our founding when it used to be three of us, we do this thing called Nova Credits, pun intended, where we go around and we give somebody credit for something that they did during the course of the last week, an anchor that credit in one of our four key company values. Another example of a ritual is we sort of created our own holiday on our anniversary, every year, every time we turned a year older, called Nations Day, where we invite obviously the company plus ones and twos and threes and investors and people that have been around the company and involved in any capacity. And we celebrate the richness of the world, how diverse having a group of people from all over the world working together on a shared mission. That‚Äôs another example of a ritual and so for the founders out there interested in creating a rich culture, it‚Äôs really about being very deliberate in how we create rituals that embody our mission and embody our values.\nAnand [8:50] : I also remember visiting your office and seeing all those flags on the wall. Those are pretty powerful. I still remember it.\nMisha [8:58] : It‚Äôs I mean, it was one of those rituals where every time we build a new country integration, so when we added India or Mexico or the UK, we added flags from those countries to our walls, we also added maps, historical maps of those countries that everybody in the company got to sign that are on our walls in the office. It‚Äôs little things like that, that go a long way in creating this environment and this sort of sense of shared mission.\nAnand [9:24] : Makes sense, and primarily for you guys, it‚Äôs really about diversity as well, and making sure that it‚Äôs a key part of the mission.\nMisha [9:32] : Yeah, for sure. And it‚Äôs not only part of the mission, it‚Äôs part of our company strategy is one of our objectives and our OKRs, the last three years now has been focused on creating a diverse team where everybody can be their best self. And that‚Äôs another area that we, as a leadership team and executives and as a company, we spent an incredible amount of time to ensure that we‚Äôre building an organization that is enduring.\n\nDoing Well\nAnand [9:58] : Awesome and that‚Äôs actually a great segue into the next part, which is, about Doing Well by Doing Good. The first part of that is doing well. What is your business strategy? And you don‚Äôt have to mention all of it here, but how do you make money? How do you make your business sustainable in the short term and long term?\nMisha [10:18] : Yeah, so Nova Credit is is free for consumers, we don‚Äôt charge consumers anything. We make all of our revenue through the enterprise. So the way our business model works is when a consumer decides to apply for a new financial product, credit card, student loan, auto loan, mortgage, or whatever, without Nova credit, that consumer in unable to get approved because like we talked about earlier, they don‚Äôt have a US credit history. Through our capability, we significantly increase their likelihood of approval, and every time that we get somebody approved, we create value and ultimately, the enterprise is willing to pay us some revenue or an enterprise license in order to be able to attract and retain this customer segment. And so the value prop to to the financial services industry is that the immigrant or the newcomer customer segment is one that is highly attractive, yet structurally underserved. And it‚Äôs also really large in terms of its representation of US population growth. So, newcomers today account for the majority of US population growth. I think it‚Äôs roughly 60% right now. There are more people who move to the US every year than there are new Americans born. And if you fast forward 2030 years according to the US Census Bureau, US newcomers are expected to account for roughly 80% of population growth, meaning that there are five times more people moving to the US than there are Americans born and that‚Äôs a function largely of a declining birth rate in the US and that‚Äôs a demographic challenge that we have as a country that‚Äôs being filled with migration.\nAnand [12:06] : That‚Äôs actually very intriguing. I did not know that stat. So then, if I understand correctly, the more credit passports you provide, to end users, essentially, the more the more money you can make at the same time, the more impact you‚Äôre making, because the more you‚Äôre providing access to each one of these end users.\nMisha [12:29] : That‚Äôs right. So every time we help somebody relocate to the US and get established with all the services that they need‚Äîgetting their bank account, getting their credit card, getting their student loan, getting their cell phone plan, getting a place to live in an apartment lease‚Äîthose are opportunities that prior to Nova have information challenges and are really hard to access. But by plugging those holes we are able to create a win-win, we‚Äôre able to create a win for the consumer because they will get the service that they need and we‚Äôre able to get to create a win for the enterprise because they‚Äôre able to retain a consumer that they otherwise don‚Äôt know how to serve.\nAnand [13:05] : Got it.So it‚Äôs a win-win-win for everybody. Cool. One follow up question on that. Have you ever had a case where creating value for business shareholders has been in conflict with your mission or culture? And how have you resolved that if that were ever the case?\nMisha [13:27] : Yeah, I mean, you run into this challenge all all the time, right? Where you have to, when you‚Äôre figuring out your product roadmap or where to focus your go-to-market efforts, ultimately, as a venture-backed, social enterprise, we need to establish an enduring business model. Otherwise, we are default dead as a company. We won‚Äôt survive and won‚Äôt be able to bring to life the potential of what our company stands for and all the good that it can create. So there‚Äôs constantly this tension of how do we drive commercial outcomes, how do we drive more revenue for the business which can come and come in conflict with how do we drive the most impact. So for example, if you are a migrant to the US, that does not have foreign credit history, that is a problem that we really can‚Äôt solve today. But arguably, many of those consumers are actually most in need. And so from a mission perspective, we want to solve that problem. And I hope one day we will solve that problem. But we haven‚Äôt quite cracked the product for how to do that as well as a commercial opportunity for how to do so in an enduring manner. And so we have to focus on consumers who have credit history in their home countries. And in doing so we can create a create that win-win-win establishing an enduring business model, and then have the opportunity and the privilege to go and solve higher impact problems even beyond the core one.\n\nDoing Good \nAnand [15:03] : I thought this is actually a perfect transition into doing good, Because you talked a little bit about how you‚Äôre helping a number of different segments, and that you hope as you grow and as you get larger, you can hopefully address some more of those segments that that you currently may not. So in 10 years, when Nova Credit is this huge success, what global challenge will you have helped solve?\nMisha [15:31] : Globally, there are more migrants than there are people in the US. So it‚Äôs an incredibly large population around the world. Not all of them face this problem today. For example, I immigrated to the states from Russia, I have a US credit history, I‚Äôm not faced by this challenge anymore. But if I were to move to Canada or the UK or wherever, this is a problem that I would face again, and so my hope is we‚Äôll get there faster than 10 years. And my hope is that the challenge of accessing financial services around the world as you move around the world will become a solved problem. And I think we‚Äôre in an incredibly strong position to be able to be the ones that solve that problem not only here in the US, but wherever people move the UK, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Dubai, etc. I think beyond that there‚Äôs an opportunity to create a more global financial ecosystem. And that really speaks to this notion of how consumers today are really siloed in terms of their ability to access financial services only where they are domiciled. So if you‚Äôre based in Mexico, you can really only get access to financial services from Mexican financial institutions. But my hope is in a 10 year timeline, that paradigm will shift where no matter where you‚Äôre based, if you have custody, if you have control, if you have access to your own information, you have an opportunity to access Financial Services around the world. And I think that can create a really exciting shift that creates a huge benefit for consumers and their ability to get the best products, not only in their home country, but wherever those best products may be around the world. It‚Äôs a similar parallel to how you can shop on Amazon, all over the world, or buy stocks all over the world. Many, many industries have become really global, and are available globally. But the financial services industry is still very much siloed to a national border.\nAnand [17:33] : So then basically global access to financial services, no matter where you‚Äôre from.\nMisha [17:39] : You got it. That would be a really cool world to be a part of, because ultimately, it makes it creates better financial products for consumers all over the world. And that‚Äôs the world that we want to be a part of.\nWhy For-profit?\nAnand [17:51] : You alluded to this a little bit before, but why build a for-profit business as opposed to a nonprofit?\nMisha [17:59] : Yeah, this is a debate, my co founder, Nicky and I, had many times in the early days. And I think ultimately, the reason that we settled on a for-profit model is that we believed that we could solve this problem a lot faster and with a lot more scale as a for-profit business. And that really hinges on our ability to access capital as a company and to raise the capital we need to assemble the team to solve the problem that we‚Äôve set out to solve.\nAnand [18:33] : Yep, so it‚Äôs a matter of capital and a matter of growth.\nMisha [18:38] : It‚Äôs capital, which allows you to assemble the team that you need in order to solve the problem that you‚Äôve set out to solve. So now we are a Series B business and we raised about 70 million to date. You know, is there a world that we could have amassed 70 million as a nonprofit and assembled the caliber of team that we have? I mean it‚Äôs possible but I‚Äôm a believer in the fastest path to creating impact is as a for-profit social enterprise. And that‚Äôs really the philosophical approach that we‚Äôve taken.\n\nAdvice for Listeners\nAnand [19:12] : Yep. Makes a lot of sense. This has been great, by the way. Thanks again for taking the time. I wanted to end off this interview with a little bit of advice for the audience. I wanted to ask you what advice would you give to founders trying to build a Doing Well by Doing Good startup like Nova Credit, or professionals looking to work for one?\nMisha [19:35] : I got maybe two thoughts on this one. For the founders out there, I think be really honest with yourself about whether the problem that you‚Äôve set out to solve really resonates with you because obviously the founding journey is not an easy one. It is a hell of a roller coaster. And there are far more lows and there are highs and so you have to deeply care about this problem, otherwise you won‚Äôt endure the roller coaster that you‚Äôll have to go through in order to actually crack it. You know, one of my mentors when I was first exploring starting Nova, you know, we spent a lot of time just like thinking through the problem statement, and I really struggled with finding the courage to actually start the business.\nAnand [20:32] : I could never imagine you wavering on starting a company seemed like a natural founder.\nMisha [20:38] : It was a really tough call for a variety of reasons, because there‚Äôs a lot of, you know, a lot of risk or perceived risk in starting a company. But one of the pieces of advice that most resonated with me was:\n\n‚Äúyou can never cross the chasm in two steps. It always takes one giant leap.‚Äù\n\nAnd what that meant to me is, as we were learning about this problems and were conceptualizing what a product solution could look like, we kept learning more and hoping that by learning more we would remove the leap of faith involved in actually going out and starting a company. But in reality, the more you learn, the more you know is harder to solve. And so that also increases the perceived risk despite you knowing more because you know more about the challenges. And so ultimately coming to terms as a founder and having to find the courage to actually just give it a shot, is a life‚Äôs work in and of itself for a lot of people. It was years of work for me. But I look back at that decision of actually going forward with starting Nova with incredible fondness because it‚Äôs resulted in a very rich journey, rich in the sense of building character, and really growing as a human in building this business, and we‚Äôve got a lot more to do. We‚Äôre only just getting started and only starting to have a chance of becoming a viable and enduring company.\nI think for the, you know, professionals out there that are not interested in founding, but are looking for businesses that are Doing Well by Doing Good. My advice would be to really focus on this combination of team, impact and learning. Those are signs. That‚Äôs kind of like the Venn diagram, that I think about making professional decisions and anytime I‚Äôm speaking with somebody about or offering some perspective on career decision. I think how you rank those is going to be different for different people over time. Some people impact is the most important thing other people learning other people team. I think it‚Äôs a personal decision for how you rank those three. But ultimately, you want to find an opportunity that has all three, you want to find a team that you are incredibly excited to be in the trenches with. You want to find a role and an opportunity that is going to grow you as a functional leader, as a person that‚Äôs going to drive your character development. And you want to find an opportunity that actually resonates with you emotionally in terms of the impact that you‚Äôre having. You want to find an opportunity where at the end of a hard day you can look yourself in the mirror and say I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôm working on. And irrespective of the outcome, whether this becomes a huge success, or it flattens out, or we‚Äôre going to spend 10 years and not really get anywhere, I‚Äôm proud of this chapter, because I care about dedicating a chapter of my career to solving this problem.\n**Anand [23:28] : **That‚Äôs super actionable advice.

Good to be with you Anand.\n**Anand [0:42] : **Why don‚Äôt we just jump right in? How would you describe Ride Health in one line?\nImran [0:49] : So Ride Health drives access to care for vulnerable populations who face transportation barriers due to affordability, age-related or mobility-related reasons and we believe in a world where no one has to forego care, just because they can‚Äôt get there.\nAnand [1:08] : Makes a lot of sense. You know, honestly, that‚Äôs one of the reasons we‚Äôre really excited to have you. Because Ride Health certainly is Doing Well by Doing Good. Really excited to talk to you.\nImran [1:19] : Thanks for having me.\nAnand [1:20] : Why don‚Äôt we jump into, you know, kind of the background. So how did you get here? What was your founding journey?\nImran [1:26] : So about seven years ago, I was a volunteer in a hospital down in North Carolina, where I‚Äôm from originally, and I was doing kind of midnight or 9pm to midnight shift in the ER, and this patient was discharged, came out into the waiting area. He came up to me because I was the first person who he saw and he said that he didn‚Äôt have a way of getting home. He had been taken there in an ambulance, maybe eight hours earlier, but now he was being discharged at like 11:58p and he didn‚Äôt know how he was going to get home. And so I said suggested that he go over to the nurse‚Äôs station to see if they could help him out with a cab voucher or a bus pass. And he went over there and talk to them. And they told him that they didn‚Äôt have anything for him that you‚Äôd have to figure something else out. And so he was kind of wandering around a little aimlessly. I went up and asked him, What do you plan to do? And he said that he might try to walk home. And I asked him where he lived. And he described this part of town that was about eight or nine miles away from the facility. And this guy was like 60-65 years old, he was kind of off-balance and staggering a bit. And he told me that he had been given some medication during his stay that had compromised his vision. So he couldn‚Äôt see all that well. So no part of this sounded like a good idea for this guy to just go off into the night. And so the only thing I could think to do in the moment standing there was to offer him a ride home, because my shift was ending at midnight. And so that‚Äôs what happened. He took me up on it and we went out to my car, drove home and dropped him off and everything went fine.\nBut it was a little weird driving a total stranger home in the middle of the night, as you might imagine. And it kind of got the gears turning in my mind about why that had been the outcome of that situation. And so I became curious about the role that something as simple and taken for granted as mobility actually plays impacting people‚Äôs ability to access resources or just to get home safely. And so that curiosity led me to study the issue a bit further. And a couple years later, in 2015, on kind of a fluke, ended up getting an article published in The Atlantic about the transportation barrier to healthcare. And, you know, it was still kind of an academic interest, but about a year later, I was in a business plan competition as I was wrapping up undergrad, and that opportunity, or that that process gave me the idea opportunity to flesh out more of the product vision, the value prop, the key details. We lost the business plan competition. So that was a bit of a bummer. But I felt like there was something there. And when you identify a problem like that, and you see a reasonable path toward solving it, it‚Äôs kind of hard to forget that. And so about a year after that, so we‚Äôre getting to 2017, I was finally able to jump full time and start the company. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing ever since.\nAnand [4:37] : Wow, that is a very intriguing founding story. And it makes a lot of sense. I‚Äôm curious, actually, how did how did that end up? Did that patient ever have to come back to the ER? Did you ever meet that patient again?\nImran [4:55] : It‚Äôs a good question. I actually have no idea what happened. Never got any contact information for the patient. It was literally just as simple as he was there. I was going home, you need to get home and I dropped him off. So I hope he‚Äôs doing doing all right wherever he is.\nAnand [5:13] : Yeah, that‚Äôs amazing. Well, hopefully now Ride Health can help with with that situation.\nImran [5:20] : Well, it‚Äôs funny. About a year ago, we started working with the hospital that I was actually was a volunteer in. And we set up a program that started with a scope around hospital discharge. And of course, now it‚Äôs expanded to all the other parts of the hospital and health system, but it was a definitely a full-circle moment.\nAnand [5:40] : Wow. That is very cool. Great story. So one question around that story, you know, what challenges did you face along the way ever since 2015, 2017 and what resources have you been able to use to overcome some of those challenges?\nImran [6:01] : Yeah, absolutely great question. The challenges are kind of, you know, when you‚Äôre going through the experience of starting a company and identifying and validating your assumptions, trying to figure out the right way to grow. There can be a temptation to subsidize that growth. But we‚Äôve really strived for organic growth. And really, the help has come from countless advisors and mentors along the way to get more specific. One of the key challenges we faced early on was skepticism of using new forms of mobility. So think back to 2016/2017. On Demand TNCs, Uber and Lyft were proliferating, those are just kind of the big names but they‚Äôre kind of symbolic of a broader shift toward more technology-enabled and digitally-connected forms of mobility. Hospitals were almost allergic to that notion because of the perceived risk, and so we had to really overcome a lot of that and build a lot of trust. Hard to imagine now, but, you know, three or four years ago, that was certainly the case. I think another challenge that we that we faced which the every company faces is balancing your early pilots and deployments with the need to constantly be fundraising and getting resources, you know, for your organization to grow. It‚Äôs an incredibly challenging balance at a very vulnerable point for a company, if you‚Äôre not kind of at a standing start.\nYou know, I often equate it to rubbing sticks together to make a fire at that early stage, and so that was another key challenge. And then there‚Äôs personnel related challenges that any company has: sometimes multiple co-founders, there can be different levels of being involved. Among those co-founders need to kind of hash those out and make sure that you‚Äôre always acting in the best interest of the company long-term. When you‚Äôre growing rapidly so is your employee and team base. There‚Äôs an importance of building and maintaining trust among those different teams, as a company grows, and you start to have certain parts of the organization that are focused on sales and client services and other parts of the organization that are focused more on product or engineering or other functions. There‚Äôs just natural tensions and trade offs that arise. How do you build that trust among those teams? And how do you do all of this when you‚Äôre doing it for the first time, right. So as a first-time founder, you haven‚Äôt made a lot of these mistakes before. And so you have to continually be self-aware and thoughtful enough to learn from those and accept those mistakes and those failures and move forward. So in terms of the resources that have helped navigate those challenges. Early on, we joined StartUp Health. So back in 2017, almost before I was even full time on Ride Health, we got into StartUp Health and that was really useful. They‚Äôve been great from the standpoint of helping us work through a framework for building the company, connected us to an amazing community of fellow entrepreneurs or health transformers, as they call them. And that‚Äôs been super valuable. Some podcasts are always good for inspiration. There‚Äôs, you know, ones, everyone listens to ‚ÄúHow I built this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasters of Scale‚Äù. And some more niche ones on the health care or mobility sides. You know, there‚Äôs some great books: ‚ÄúHard Thing about Hard Things‚Äù. It was funny, I got that as a gift from some of my colleagues, maybe six months ago. Yeah, cuz they said, you‚Äôre reading this at the wrong time. You should have read this three years ago. And then on the inside it says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only person who would read this after doing the hard thing‚Äù. By no means have we done it, but it was still a funny note.\n\nMission &amp; Culture\nAnand [10:04] : No, I mean, that is a really great book. Frankly, I wish I had read it earlier as well. I really like your analogy of sticks rubbing together. I mean, that‚Äôs a great analogy for starting starting a company. You know, you take whatever resources you have, and you try to make something good out of it. So yeah, absolutely. Cool. So, I wanted to transition to, you talked about personnel, right, I thought that was really interesting, and probably one of the most important things as you grow the company. So what is your company mission? And how do you create a culture that embodies that?\nImran [10:43] : Absolutely.\n\n‚ÄúWe ensure that every patient everywhere can access the care and resources that they need to ensure good health.‚Äù\n\nAnd I guess I could take a step back and share with folks what Ride Health actually does for a second in support of that mission. In essence, we build technology that enables hospitals and health insurance plans to manage transportation programs for their patients and members. So it‚Äôs a web-based platform that care coordinators and social workers use to coordinate rides for patients who are low-income or elderly or have physical mobility limitations. And we connect to a national network of transportation providers across all levels of service from public transit, to ride hailing taxis, to non-emergency medical transportation for patients who need extra assistance door-to-door, door-to-door wheelchair accessible, up to stretcher vans and ambulance. And so that‚Äôs really what we do and as I said our mission is to ensure every patient everywhere can access the care and resources that they need.\nAnand [11:56] : So that makes a lot of sense. It sounds like the patients are really the focus at Ride Health helping to make sure that they can get to where they need to go. So then the question I have is as you hire people, whether it‚Äôs for engineering, whether it‚Äôs for product, how do you maintain that culture? Do you have certain questions that you ask people? Do you make sure that people come from a certain background that helps them understand the problem? You know, what do you do to ensure that the culture continues as you grow the company?\nImran [12:23] :\n\n‚ÄúYeah. So it starts with our core values. And there‚Äôs five of those we talk about: people first, intellectual humility, embrace complexity, own your outcomes, and long term mindset.‚Äù\n\nSo those five, you can kind of fit them on an index card. And they‚Äôre kind of meant to be memorable, at least internally. And that feeds into the Ride Health way, which is something that we wrote perhaps a year, year and a half ago. And the Ride Health way is a set of operating principles that expand on those core values and are intended to drive day-to-day decision making.\nAnd so for example, you know, I talked about people first as a core value. The Ride Health way expansion on that is that we put people first by believing in their dignity and worth and good intentions. So that principle kind of translates both externally, because, you know, we‚Äôre working with with highly vulnerable, highly complex patients and health plan members and coordinators. And these can be very stressful situations. These can be people who are in, you know, really tough social circumstances, they‚Äôre going through their medical care journey, and they‚Äôre not always bringing their best selves to those situations and whether we‚Äôre working with folks with our contact center, interfacing with patients or drivers or coordinators, or some of our team members on the client success side, they always keep in mind the dignity and worth of people. And those are kind of Social Work values. We‚Äôve had a team member who very early on, has been a part of the company. And she came from a background of 10 years in social work, and really has upheld that value internally. The good intentions part I think, is really important when you‚Äôre thinking about putting people first internally within your team. And you know, even though people will disagree on different ways to do things, I think you have to assume good intent. And that‚Äôs an important principle for us.\nAnother example of this is: I talked about intellectual humility. The Ride Health way expansion on that is that we are intellectually humble in that we ask questions and admit mistakes. I think this is something that applies to a lot of startups where you‚Äôre constantly learning new things, you‚Äôre having your assumptions challenged or proven wrong. And it‚Äôs really important to always ask those questions and to admit when you‚Äôve made mistakes or have been off mark. So those are a couple of examples of how we create a culture that embodies and helps deliver on that mission.\nAnand [15:08] : That‚Äôs awesome. So those are sort of five pillars that are easily memorizable for every employee. Yeah, that‚Äôs great. I think conflict is natural, and things change really fast in a startup. So you have got to have some set of core values so that you know how to resolve them and get through the challenges makes a lot of sense. That‚Äôs a very great way to maintain culture and it‚Äôs quite admirable.\nImran [15:41] : Well, there‚Äôs a whole lot of other things that go into it. But that‚Äôs what I think it has to start with and you have to trust that that will resonate with people and that at the end of the day, the culture is upheld by all of us collectively, within the company not by some master plan.\n\nDoing Well \nAnand [15:57] : Of course. Yeah. It‚Äôs a team effort. Well, I thought, you know, we could transition over to Doing Well by Doing Good. So Doing Well, obviously the first thing that‚Äôs important to build a sustainable business is to have a business plan, a way to make money both in the short-term and long-term. Could you talk a little bit about the plan and the business plan of Ride Health and how you guys make money?\n**Imran [16:25] : **Yeah, absolutely. So I think one of the most important things that any company can have early on, especially throughout their lifecycle is an understanding of unit economics. So we think about is a couple things, principally is net revenue per ride. So we are paid, in addition to the cost of the ride, which is like a pass through, there‚Äôs an admin fee and that covers our costs of providing real time ride operations support, maintaining the platform and all the transactions that are happening there, and building and managing a network of transportation providers. And so when we think about our unit economics, it‚Äôs that net revenue per ride. And subtracted from that is our human-driven and our technology-driven costs on a per ride basis. And that gets us to a gross contribution margin per ride. And that then translates with a couple other inputs into our overall gross margin and then net margin. And so we‚Äôve, from a very early point, kind of understood that. It wasn‚Äôt as though we were searching for a business model. Maybe back to what I mentioned earlier, we never believed in subsidizing growth, we always wanted to have growth that was real, real customers, investing in transportation and being willing to pay our fee on top of that because they believed in the value add of the service. And so we have had from day one, you know, positive contribution margins on a per ride basis. And those have been getting better and better. And now\n\n‚Äúwe‚Äôre at the point where, based on our plans across people and technology that we have for the rest of this year, next year, it will be possible to achieve SaaS-like margins within the context of a tech-enabled service coordination business, which will be pretty exciting to realize in the coming months, and years.‚Äù\n\nSo I think that‚Äôs really important for people to have thoughts around, especially in the current environment. What happened with the pandemic has been tightening valuations, it‚Äôs been upping the ante for diligence. And companies that don‚Äôt have clarity around this will find it much more difficult, I think, to advance.\nAnand [18:52] : Right! That makes a lot of sense. So in this case, you guys are working on creating those sort of larger margins, the SaaS margins in order to create a sustainable business on a per-unit basis. And then of course, if it works on a unit basis, then it‚Äôll work at on an aggregate basis as well.\nOne question I have, especially doing what right health is doing and obviously being very mission-driven: Is there a case where you‚Äôve seen sort of your business model go against maybe what your mission and culture is, or maybe any times where you had to make a choice? And you had to figure out how to resolve a conflict between the two?\nImran [19:43] : Yeah, it‚Äôs a great question. So we, about a year and a half ago, maybe started to realize that our pricing model was off. We had been charging on a kind of a software license base ‚Äî kind of a pay-per-user type model. And what we learned was that the number of users was not necessarily coordinated, correlated with the number of rides being coordinated. And that there would be some power users and that there would be some disengaged users, which is obvious in retrospect. But we thought it would kind of all balance out and turned out, it wasn‚Äôt if you looked across every account. And so we had to make a decision about whether to go with more of a utilization based model, which was a little bit of a odd thing when you think about how healthcare is moving toward more sort of payment for value rather than for volume, to have a utilization based model. Philosophically, even if it‚Äôs not, even if it makes more sense, and customers want to pay for it that way. It still felt a little bit odd. So we‚Äôve been in that utilization-based model for, you know, a year, year and a half now. And what‚Äôs interesting is that the business is now starting to shift more back into the realm of fixed fee. But you know, it‚Äôs in the context of better predictability around volume at the program level. So all of that is kind of minutia that‚Äôs not super relevant to your question, but I guess it was important at all stages of that decision process that we made sure that we were interrogating, and asking ourselves whether our pricing model was fitting not only with what we valued, but also what our customers valued, and that it would work for our business model itself. Because there were times when those things were not in balance. And so I think more broadly,\n\n‚Äúto the point of how do you balance you know, shareholder value with with mission and culture it‚Äôs really about joining the two together and not treating them like two separate spheres or conversations.‚Äù\n\nI think, you know, what we try to do is to communicate to the team, what our board cares about. And we try to communicate to our board what our team cares about and what our customers care about. And I think in that context, people can make decisions about whether the environment aligns with their values. And most healthcare oriented investors are fairly mission-driven, and long-term minded to some degree anyway, and they understand the long sales cycles, they understand the opportunity to invest in making an impact and building valuable relationships. So it hasn‚Äôt been I say, a huge challenge. But that‚Äôs one of the things that we‚Äôve thought about for the past year, year and a half, especially.\n\nDoing Good\n**Anand [22:45] : **Totally, now that makes a lot of sense. And it‚Äôs great that you have sort of a two-way communication channel as well between the team and in the board. That‚Äôs great. Let‚Äôs move on to Doing Good. In 10 years when Ride Health is a huge success, what global challenge will Ride Health have helped solve?\nImran [23:07] : Yeah, so globally, you know, health and mobility are each multi-trillion dollar sectors. What we see is that they‚Äôre rarely connected in a thoughtful way. There‚Äôs kind of healthcare world and mobility or transportation world. And so transportation barriers and constraints to health and other resources for that matter, are a global challenge.\n\n‚ÄúOur general endgame is to define that intersection and to solve for the problem of access to resources, connecting people with places in a manner that is impactful to their health and well being.‚Äù\n\nAnand [23:51] : Yeah, and that is a serious problem. So it‚Äôs great that you guys are solving it. And you know this is always a question that I have because of what we‚Äôre talking about: Doing Well by Doing Good. Why build a for-profit business rather than a nonprofit?\nImran [24:09] : Yeah, that‚Äôs great question. We considered this very early on. And at the end of the day, it was the access to diverse funding streams. And, you know, being more than just grants so you can get angel investment, venture capital, debt financing. And then, in addition to that, I think the for-profit model forces you to think earlier about self-sustainability, instead of kind of the reliance on a grant cycle that can kind of drain energy and resources from the mission. And so for us, it was a pretty easy decision, but it was one that we examined just given the inherently social nature of what we‚Äôre doing, so great question.\nAnand [24:59] : In terms of funding strategies I‚Äôm curious because there‚Äôs, of course, where can you get the money from? What about growth? So do you think that with the for-profit model and with the VC model, you‚Äôre able to grow faster, for whatever reason, right? Because you get more funding, because you‚Äôre able to focus on the business model. Do you feel like that‚Äôs also one aspect of it?\nImran [25:24] : I think we absolutely have been able to grow more quickly. With that funding, you often hear the phrase, VCs sell rocket fuel, it‚Äôs not for everyone or for every organization. But if you‚Äôre looking to make this type of impact on a broad scale, it‚Äôs definitely worthy of consideration.\nAnand [25:45] : And so I guess, in this case, the rocket fuel does help.\nImran [25:52] : Absolutely.\n\nAdvice for Listeners\nAnand [25:54] : Well this has been obviously very interesting and thanks again for taking the time out. For the audience, one thing that I wanted to ask before we go is, what advice would you give for somebody who either maybe a founder who wants to start a company that‚Äôs Doing Well by Doing Good, or professionals that just want to work for a company like that? What advice would you give?\nImran [26:24] : Well, so I have a couple. Well, I guess it‚Äôs around financing. And it‚Äôs a couple pieces of advice: I think the first is about angel investors, which were very important for us early on and continue to be important partners and members of our community. Angel investors, at least those who orient toward healthcare, in my experience, are generally looking to put their money into companies that have a social mission and impact. It‚Äôs a really important motivator for why they‚Äôre doing that in the first place and how they choose the companies that they want to spend time with. So in those early conversations, you know, don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of focusing on that aspect with angels. When you get to a later stage, and you‚Äôre dealing with more institutional investors or groups, they‚Äôre much more answerable to their LPs. And you‚Äôll need to bring much more to the table in terms of a long term sustainable business model. And that‚Äôs where having that focus on unit economics early on, and having an airtight understanding of them will be very, very helpful. So I just wanted to kind of share that reflection looking back on our financing journey, like what mattered most at each stage, at least for us.\n**Anand [27:48] : **That‚Äôs super valuable. And it makes sense. I mean, naturally, any company that that goes through the funding process has to go through those stages. How about for professionals that want to work at a company like Ride Health, what advice would you give?\nImran [28:06] : Yeah, I would say that it‚Äôs important to be realistic with yourself about the type of environment that you will thrive in. It‚Äôs one thing to think about working at a company that is Doing Well by Doing Good. That‚Äôs a concept I think everybody can get excited about and get behind. But I think it‚Äôs important to be realistic about the stresses, challenges and trade offs that come with joining a very early stage high risk enterprise, of course, and people need to sort of be very self-aware about whether that‚Äôs the environment in which they will succeed. And I think many of them can, but it‚Äôs just important to ask yourself those questions and talk to people to really understand what it‚Äôs going to be like, especially if you‚Äôre transitioning from a more corporate environment, or just haven‚Äôt been in a startup environment before.\nAnand [28:58] : Absolutely. That‚Äôs great advice. And with that thank you so much for being on the show. Really appreciate it!\nImran [29:07] : Yeah, thanks! These are great questions. Great conversation.

Hope you enjoy!\n\n\nFounding Story\nAnand [0:37] : All right, welcome to the show, Stephen! All right. So I thought we could just jump right in.\nStefan [0:49] : Totally. Sounds great.\nAnand [0:51] : All right. So how would you describe Shelf Engine in one line?\nStefan [0:56] : Shelf Engine does demand forecasting for grocery stores, and it guarantees the sales for those grocery stores.\nAnand [1:03] : All right. That‚Äôs great. Very simple. I love it.\nStefan [1:09] : Why do you think it‚Äôs simple? I think it‚Äôs complicated once in a while.\nAnand [1:12] : Well, the one line has got to be simple. Nobody really knows the background. That‚Äôs all the magic. Cool. So I thought we could start with your background. I mean, how did you get here? What was your founding journey?\nStefan [1:26] : Yeah, totally. I guess you could start with me as a young child. I‚Äôve always been super interested in the food world and understanding what was happening there. In college, I was very involved in everything that was sustainable food and the food movement. And coming out of college, I decided to do something a little crazy, which was actually start a food company. So I started a food production and distribution company, and while a lot of my friends were going out and being you know, software engineer, working in finance or lawyers or whatever, I decided I was going to start a food company. And it was maybe one of the hardest one most fascinating things I‚Äôve ever done in my life. So I grew a company that was a production and distribution company, grew it for about a decade and eventually sold it. But it was, in that time at my company that I essentially got to learn so much about what was happening in the food world, and got me to understand why there‚Äôs so much food waste in the system. And realizing that actually reducing that food waste was very attainable. And that‚Äôs when I was able to lock in on this part about what‚Äôs happening with grocery buyers, and how buying in grocery stores works.\nAnand [2:47] : All right. That sounds great. And you know, one question I have on that is, I‚Äôm sure you had a lot but what are some of the most difficult challenges you faced up until now in that journey?\nStefan [3:01] : In that journey, you mean before founding the company or once once founding the company?\nAnand [3:07] : You know, I think we can go with both.\nStefan [3:09] : Awesome, I think after founding the company, and this may be part of the story that hadn‚Äôt shared yet, but you know, my co founder and I, we were just friends talking about this idea. And then one day, we‚Äôre just like, we have to, we have to go make this happen. When we launched the business, we thought that, hey, if we were just going to build something that could forecast and outperform the human decision, and really be able to reduce food waste in a major way at the grocery store, we thought, Oh, well, you know, every grocery store is going to license our technology, then we‚Äôre going to be able to essentially go in and have a really cool SaaS product and every grocery store is going to take it in. And that‚Äôs not how it happened at all.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe one of the greatest challenges that I witnessed was that it‚Äôs not just what you build, but the business model that you build around it and if you don‚Äôt build the right business model, you can have the greatest product or the greatest solution and it really just doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù\n\nBecause adoption won‚Äôt be there, attraction won‚Äôt be there. And that was that was tough. That was really tough. Especially when we were seeing the success of what we built in the field and seeing the stores using what we were doing. And we‚Äôre like, God, you guys are literally cutting your waste in half. How is this not catching on like wildfire across the country? And it‚Äôs not until we changed our business model and started evolving there that we were able to see that.\n\nMission &amp; Culture\nAnand [4:33] : Cool. Well, I‚Äôm excited to talk about that business model in just a little bit. So let‚Äôs let‚Äôs move on to mission. You know, this is obviously critical for every company, but in particular one like yours that‚Äôs, you know, doing something that‚Äôs really changing the world. What is your company mission? And how do you create a culture that embodies it?\nStefan [4:55] : Yeah, I mean, great question.\n\n‚ÄúOur mission is to reduce food waste through automation. And the two key pieces there ‚Äî reduce food waste and automation ‚Äî are really what drive us.‚Äù\n\nBecause you could reduce food waste in many other ways. But we think it‚Äôs important to have an automated methodology long-term for it to catch on, and then be something that we rely on society. building a culture around it has been quite interesting because there‚Äôs some tension around the execution piece as well as the end goal. And a lot of people when they come and join the company get very excited about reducing food waste. What the reality is, is that our customers don‚Äôt necessarily speak in that language. Our customers speak in the language of saying, how do you help my P&amp;L? How do you have my shelves look fuller? How do you make my sales go up? So transforming what we‚Äôre doing really wanting to accomplish to the language of the customer is maybe some of the greatest tension you have there on a cultural level. Now, what‚Äôs interesting is that the more that we are implemented, the more we reduce food waste. So the overall mission is accomplished. But to be able to get ourselves in there, we need to essentially speak the language of the grocery stores. So that part was somewhat challenging. The part about building around what we were doing the, the part that got us a lot of momentum, and helped a lot was the fact that we were able to see this impact so quickly. And when we were able to launch with major national grocery chains and then see the impact we were able to make for them and also the reduction in food waste. That kind of win just brings a lot of momentum for the team.\nAnand [6:54]: Right! So it‚Äôs really connecting the business model with that mission and translating the two and making sure they‚Äôre always in sync.\nStefan [7:03]: Yeah, that‚Äôs a really nice and succinct way of putting it. And that‚Äôs absolutely the case. I don‚Äôt think that I would ever walk into a meeting with a big grocer and say: Hey, our goal is just to reduce food waste. They‚Äôd be like, well, that‚Äôs nice. So, you know, what are you doing here? But when I go in, and I say, Hey, you know, we can really transform your P&amp;L, we‚Äôre going to be able to really increase your profits, lowering your food waste, then they‚Äôre really interested, then they‚Äôre ready to talk.\n\nDoing Well\nAnand [7:34] : That‚Äôs, that makes a lot of sense. And actually, that‚Äôs a good transition into the next part that I really wanted to talk about. How does Shelf Engine do well? What makes your business sustainable, both in the short-term and the long-term? What value do you provide to the customer?\nStefan [7:52] : Yeah, good question. So taking a step back and understanding the business model a little bit. What Shelf Engine does is we go into a store and we manage the ordering for a given category. And the ordering basically happens every day. So let‚Äôs just say that we‚Äôre coming in and we‚Äôre managing the bakery section of the grocery store. We buy from the vendors and the vendors that they were already using. And we pay the vendors for everything that sold. We only charged the store for items that sell. Then you know, I think a lot of people probably ask themselves, okay, interesting. How do you make money? So what we do is we mark up the price of the products from the vendors to the store. Now that markup then is fixed, but it‚Äôs always less than whatever the spoilage rate was that the store incurred. So it‚Äôs pretty normal.\n\n‚ÄúFor example, for a store to have, say a 35% spoilage rate in the bakery. We come in and we say, okay, well, we‚Äôre going to charge you a 20% markup. So you know, the store already has 15 points to draw from bottom line. And then we were managing those orders with 3% markup. Now we‚Äôre going to still incur spoilage when we order. The money we make is the delta between the spoilage we incur, and the markup.‚Äù\n\nAnd that‚Äôs really how we‚Äôre able to be sustainable and make money. Our objective is obviously to get better and better and better at forecasting, such that we can do two things: 1) increase our margin, and 2) make it better for the grocery store. So if in the long run, we‚Äôre able to make leaps and bounds on the forecast inside, we‚Äôre essentially going to get food cheaper to the consumer, have a more sustainable, healthy grocery store that has better margins, and then we‚Äôre a good, sustainable business. And what‚Äôs exciting about that to us is that you‚Äôre essentially taking waste out of the system. And the three parties I just mentioned, get benefit from that. So it‚Äôs a very long-term sustainable methodology to approach this kind of problem.\nAnand [10:05] : So it‚Äôs a win-win-win for all the three parties.\nStefan [10:09] : Indeed, indeed. And there‚Äôs a lot of other business models out there where you have a win lose, or very strong winners. In this particular case, you have very strong wins across all three parties.\nAnand [10:23] : That sounds like a very strong, sustainable business, both in the short and long term.\nStefan [10:28] : Cool. Yes, I tend to think so.\nAnand [10:32] : Well, in case I didn‚Äôt understand that, what I wanted to do is I wanted to just clarify, you‚Äôre saying that there is a spoilage rate, right? And there‚Äôs a price that you‚Äôre marking up. So there‚Äôs sort of a differential there and that differential is, is your margin. Is that a fair assessment?\nStefan [10:48] : Yep. that‚Äôs exactly right. So let‚Äôs go back to this bakery example that I was just saying. So let‚Äôs say we go to the store and they used to have a 35% spoilage rate. We come in and we start managing those orders. Now that store doesn‚Äôt incur any more spoilage, right, because we only charge him for what sells. And we charge him for that 20% markup. Well, our forecasting is essentially doing is it‚Äôs created a profit maximization model that says, for every SKU, what‚Äôs the ideal amount for that store, that SKU, that you should be delivered that day? Now, you know, some people might think, okay, we‚Äôll just deliver very little and just allow, and the problem with that is that then you‚Äôre going to crush the sales of that store.\n\n‚ÄúSo you need to make sure you‚Äôre maximizing the sales, but you‚Äôre not going too high in creating waste and you‚Äôre also not going to low and creating out of stocks, so you have to find that perfect balance. That‚Äôs where our profit maximization comes in.‚Äù\n\nNow, what that profit maximization comes in and tells essentially what that order should be and that‚Äôs what we submit to the vendors. That order will create some spoilage at a certain level. If we truly want to get to zero spoilage, we would have massive out-of-stocks. Right? So the important thing here is that we essentially have a margin between our spoilage rate and that 20% markup.\nAnand [12:14] : Yep. That makes sense. And the better you do there, the better your margin. And of course, the less you‚Äôre wasting. So it‚Äôs better for the environment. One question I always like to ask about, especially for Doing Well by Doing Good company, is, you have this business model ‚Äî do you ever have a conflict between shareholder value, the business and culture? And you touched upon it a little bit before, where is there a tension on how you translate certain things? How do you usually deal with them?\nStefan [12:52] : Yeah, luckily, I think we‚Äôre quite aligned. In many of those aspects. I think the tension that I spoke about before was more of a language to the customer. But in the overall intent, we‚Äôre quite aligned in terms of the impact we‚Äôre trying to make, as well as what it‚Äôs going to translate into in terms of strict dollars into the company. So, I feel very fortunate to be in that kind of situation right now. It makes board meetings a lot easier. I don‚Äôt have to make major ethical decisions and conversations. And look like the food supply chain is really an amazing one this country but also very antiquated. If you look at what we‚Äôre able to get on a daily basis, you can basically go into any grocery store and have numerous choices and depend on those choices basically, every day. That‚Äôs absolutely incredible. Right? But we also have a ton of waste in the system. So how do we essentially maintain that level of service, that kind of product availability, but at the same time, reduce that waste? And I think, for us, we‚Äôre perfectly in line with that, which is in line with the business decisions as well as the ethical decisions.\n\nDoing Good\nAnand [14:18] : Great. Well, I think this is a good transition then into Doing Good. So you talk about the ethical challenges in the environment, which is what you‚Äôre trying to help here. In 10 years when Shelf Engine is this huge success? What global challenge, will you help solve?\nStefan [14:36] : Yeah, it‚Äôs such a fascinating question. And this is the kind of question that gets you really excited because as a founder, you start taking on the world, right? You start saying to yourself, well, how can I just really make something big happen in the world. For me, it would probably come back down to the fact of how can we get really, really good food at a super affordable price to everybody? And I think one of the greatest things that‚Äôs happened in the last few decades in grocery is that there‚Äôs a much larger adoption of fresh foods which has put a lot of pressure on grocery. But now that we‚Äôre at this stage, and people are really focusing on that, and really care about the quality of the food, now cost is coming into the factor. Well, wouldn‚Äôt it be really cool if we could reduce all the waste in that entire flow such that people can eat really well? What are the other pieces that we could put in place, which is essentially your question to get that food to the right people such that they‚Äôre eating really well.\n\n‚ÄúI would love to see this country in a place where nobody‚Äôs going hungry and everybody is eating really good nutritious foods. If we‚Äôre able to accomplish that, that would be absolutely incredible. I‚Äôm very driven by that notion, by that vision.‚Äù\n\nAnand [16:05] : Right, so eating healthier and wasting less food. I love that. I think I need to do a little bit of work on that myself. Another question I had was, obviously since Shelf Engine is a for profit VC-backed business, how did you choose a for-profit versus nonprofit?\nStefan [16:34] : Yeah, I was fairly clear that I wanted to create something that was gonna really make a massive shift.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I am one of those people in the school of thought that if you can really align the business objectives, with something that matters for the world that you‚Äôre going to have something that‚Äôs going to be sustainable for the long term.‚Äù\n\nIf I would have started a nonprofit in this space, I don‚Äôt think we could have even come close to the impact we‚Äôve already had. So that was really important. And that was something that got me excited. It‚Äôs also, you know, there‚Äôs something really exciting and fulfilling about aligning some of the greatest minds. And some of the people who have accomplished the most in the world behind this, right? And again, I wouldn‚Äôt have really been able to do that nonprofit. So if you look at our team, our team is absolutely incredible. Brilliant engineers, data scientists, operations folks, salespeople, that‚Äôs just really an incredible team. And then what you get to do is get to go out and convince people to put money into that. And we could be talking about some people who‚Äôve done amazing things in tech. All the way to sports stars, who decided to say like, Okay, cool. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and put money into this, I want to back it, I really care that this happens. And that‚Äôs just really incredible. That‚Äôs an incredibly fulfilling experience.\nAnand [18:15] : So would you say it‚Äôs on one end, sort of a capital and resource question ‚Äî you can get a lot of resources really quickly ‚Äî And then also, perhaps it‚Äôs a growth question, which is how can you grow this as fast as possible? Would you say that‚Äôs sort of the advantage you get with the for-profit model?\nStefan [18:35] : Yeah, I would say those two parts plus the fact that people are just gonna care more because there‚Äôs money tied to it. But yes, succinctly, that‚Äôs absolutely the case.\nAnand [18:49] : Yeah. And I suppose you touched upon this before, but you know, if you can connect the two, you can connect the capital incentive to the incentive to change the world and make a serious change ‚Äî that‚Äôs really powerful and that sort of becomes a positive feedback loop.\nStefan [19:06] : Indeed, indeed. And actually, I think, you know, in the notion of what we‚Äôre doing, I think there are a lot of other opportunities, because what we essentially said is okay, there is one very highly repetitive task of buying for a given store. The average grocery store in America has between 35,000 to 40,000 SKUs. And so you have this extremely repetitive task that somebody does. And we‚Äôre essentially saying well, can we pool all of those decisions? Have AI make those decisions? Take the risk off the table, take the waste out of the system, and take the risk off of the retailers. So where are other places that we could essentially apply the same kind of notion and think to ourselves, like where are there very highly repetitive decisions where being just slightly off on every decision eventually adds up to a major cost, and in our particularly sense its environmental costs. But I think about other things that and this is why I‚Äôm so interested in the world of AI and the cost to humanity.\n\n‚ÄúWhen people are doing work that could be replaced by AI, they could be doing something more interesting, right? Those are the kinds of things that I think we can really bring our society forward where there‚Äôs a tremendous amount of opportunity.‚Äù\n\nAnand [20:25] : So like freeing up the brain space for a lot of humans to do a lot more creative work.\nStefan [20:34] : Exactly, exactly. Now, it creates a bunch of political challenges which I‚Äôm not going to talk about. There‚Äôs quite a conversation to be had there. But if you put that aside and you think to yourself, like okay, well, if we could just open up more time for humans to do interesting things. There‚Äôs a lot of people out there essentially working on smaller aspects of that, especially in the world of automation.\n\nAdvice for DWDG Audience\nAnand [20:58] : Now, automation is a huge thing. I think it‚Äôs particularly cool when automation actually is contributing directly to something so big such as food waste. So I wanted to end this with, with a little segment where you could provide some advice to, to the founders that might be trying to build a Doing Well by Doing Good startup, or professionals that are looking to work for one. So what piece of advice would you give them?\n**Stefan [21:26] : ** Man, I could probably go on for a long time on this particular side of things. You know, I think on the company building side and on creating a business model, I subscribe to probably a lot of the larger notions that you‚Äôre going to hear from Y Combinator to some of the more prolific writers out there. They‚Äôre going to share about how to build a startup, how to grow fast, etc. I think at the end of the day, if you‚Äôre gonna build a company that can do some good it needs to make a strong financial impact somewhere, and or make some sort of strong incentive for somebody to say YES. Take the example of TOMS Shoes, where they essentially donate a pair of shoes for every pair of shoes they sold. So that‚Äôs a really cool concept. But I think a lot of people misunderstood the fact that people wanted to buy TOMS Shoes. Like, it‚Äôs not like he became a wild success, because he‚Äôs donating pairs of shoes right now, like he became a wild success because people really wanted those shoes. And so don‚Äôt lose sight of that. And I think there are a lot of people who come in and say, I‚Äôm just going to start focusing on the donation part of the business model. And the problem with that, and the disappointing part with that is that you can‚Äôt really have impact without scale. So if you‚Äôre going to do something really great, but you have three customers, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. If you‚Äôre gonna do something really great and you have millions of customers it makes a HUGE impact. And that gets, that gets me excited on that side of things.\n\n‚ÄúAnd then the huge advantage, I‚Äôll say that you have, if you build a company that‚Äôs doing something good is you will get exceptional employees. You will get people who really care.‚Äù\n\nAnd probably the thing that I hear time and time again, on the recruiting side of things is people say I don‚Äôt want to work for a company that makes money from advertising. I‚Äôm kind of done with that. And there are a lot of people who say who are in space. Some of them could care about other aspects, right. We‚Äôve hired some people from financing, they‚Äôre just done with the finance world, they don‚Äôt see that adding value in so they‚Äôre really ready to move out of that space. The advantage you have by doing something good is that people will really buy into that and really care for that. You have the potential of having a better team by doing something good with your company, then just doing something like selling advertising. So I‚Äôd say you already have an advantage. Anyway, I could go on for so long. It‚Äôs very exciting people who choose to go this route time for them. It‚Äôs what we need in the world.\nAnand [24:17] : Yeah. That‚Äôs great advice, frankly, you know, any advice you want to give always always open? That‚Äôs what people want to hear. Because at the end of the day, you know, doing what you‚Äôre doing is is not that easy and I think the question that we‚Äôre always trying to answer is, how do you both do well AND do good? And there is not necessarily a simple answer for that. So I think understanding how a company like Shelf Engine can do that and how you can do that sustainably over time, and then do that again and again. How can another company do the same thing? That‚Äôs a really important thing to learn. And I think understanding what some of those aspects are that you might be exploring as well, going forward, that‚Äôs really helpful for the audience.\nStefan [25:10] Oh, yeah. And I mean, listen, I think if you‚Äôve got a listener right now, who really cares about building something, and cares about changing the world in some way?\n\n‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs just not that many people who are up for the challenge. And so, if I could give you any advice, it‚Äôs just go do it. Just go do it.‚Äù\n\nI mean, the world needs you to, and there‚Äôs potentially people who are listening, who may just have an idea right now and it could be the next thing that really transforms the way that our world functions.

In fact, it‚Äôs been around for ages as far back as biblical times‚Äî1500 BC. It has evolved through multiple forms through religions like Judaism, Islam and Christianity among others and in recent years has been driven by the demands of a democratic electorate (e.g. in the US during Vietnam, the Cold War, and many others).\n\nTurns out that even today we are making history with COVID-19 driving a new wave of impact investing as investors are starting to realize returns on their portfolios and identify the fragilities in our economy as investable trends for the future.\n\nOne of the best definitions of Impact Investing comes unsurprisingly from the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)\n\n_Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below market to market rate, depending on investors‚Äô strategic goals. _\nThe growing impact investment market provides capital to address the world‚Äôs most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.\n\nDoing Well by Doing Good is inherent in the definition. In the same way that any company wants to make a profit, any investor wants a return. The KEY difference in Doing Well by Doing Good for a business OR investor, is that they aim to make a positive impact as described in the second paragraph above. As we‚Äôve defined before, these ‚Äúpositive impacts‚Äù are none other than the ‚ÄúBasic Needs‚Äù described at the bottom of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy.\n\n\nImpact Investing is just another form of Doing Well by Doing Good.\n\nIn this post I‚Äôll list out some representative small and large examples doing just this. Since all of them inherently deploy capital, their Service and method of Doing Well are common:\n\nService : provide money, advice, and guidance to the organizations and individuals they invest in.\nDoing Well: make money from the returns they make on their funds.\n\nSO, for brevity the 2 key components that differentiate these firms are their Mission , and how they Do Good (i.e. what good do their portfolio companies do and how do the firms encourage or reward that), which is where we‚Äôll focus in our descriptions.\n_ NOTE_ : While below we will just sample a few investors from later stage and early stage pool, we‚Äôre keeping track of many more and will share the full list another post soon along with other DWDG companies ü§ì.\n\n\nFirst let‚Äôs start with some of the BIG PLAYERS in the impact investing space\n\nBreakthrough Energy Ventures\nBill Gates recently founded this climate related investment firm out of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition with a key focus in funding next generation technologies and advocating for improved policy levers. A combination of many high net worth individuals, the fund has collected over 1B in funding already and is focused on raising over 1B more over the next year.\n\nMission : ‚Äúto lead the world to net-zero by supporting cutting-edge research and development; investing in companies that turn game-changing technologies into scalable and transformative solutions; and advocating for policies that speed innovation from lab to market.‚Äù\nDoing Good: In today‚Äôs world, energy is key to survival for many communities all around the world. Access to clean and sustainable energy through microgrids is one of the only ways to receive power in many parts of the developing world, where large scale infrastructure can be cost-prohibitive. As the companies grow and expand their reach, access to reliable energy as one of the ‚ÄúBasic Needs‚Äù will also grow.\nElevar Equity \nElevar Equity is a self-proclaimed ‚Äúearly growth capital‚Äù investor focused on bridging the inequity gap for marginalized communities.\n\nMission : ‚Äúto fuel the economic resilience and vibrancy of low income communities. By spending considerable time with our customer segment, we develop a deep understanding of their aspirations, priorities, cash flows and challenges. Combined with uncompromising analysis, we translate this into concrete investment insights that are the basis of our investing in ‚Äòdeep in the weeds‚Äô, solution oriented entrepreneurs.‚Äù\nDoing Good : Elevar makes it crystal clear that the businesses they fund cannot have impact as a ‚Äúside metric‚Äù but rather impact should be correlated and aligned with business success. Impact for them means solving inequity for those marginalized populations and their companies success continue to drive equity in access to the ‚ÄúBasic Needs‚Äù\n\nLast but not least, the Early Stage VCs and Accelerators focus on building up and helping companies mature from nascent seedlings to formidable businesses. Of course in general there are MANY more smaller VCs and Accelerators than later stage firms, but most of these firms cannot be too focused because they have to diversify sufficiently. Thankfully impact investing spans a fairly wide gamut.\nSustainVC\nSustainVC is a 10-year-old manager of a number of early-stage impact investment funds focused on investing in companies creating meaningful social and/or environmental impact spanning topics from climate &amp; sustainability, equality &amp; empowerment, and health &amp; education.\n\nMission : ‚ÄúThe goal of our funds is to return measurable social and environmental impact as well as market-rate financial returns **** by backing innovative entrepreneurs that share a vision of a sustainable, more equitable and healthier world‚Äù\nDoing Good : SustainVC ties doing good directly to their mission statement by ensuring that each investment fits one their key high-level buckets. This means as the companies grow (and subsequently increase the value of their return), they deliver more impact in those buckets, all of which fit squarely in the bottom-rung of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy.\nBlue Ridge Labs\nBlue Ridge Labs is an accelerator based in New York born out of the The Labs program within the Blue Ridge Foundation and is now part of the poverty-fighting organization Robin Hood helping to propagate and help early stage companies that address economic inequality in New York. Doing Good sometimes can seem difficult when common startup advice revolves around ‚Äúsolving a problem you know best‚Äù, but by definition, those with the privilege to think about starting a company statistically will not have come from such a background. Blue Ridge Labs helps build the bridge between technologists and the communities that need the help.\n\nMission : to solve economic inequality in New York through tech-enabled solutions\nDoing Good: Blue Ridge Labs is aligned with the core missions and values of the poverty-fighting Robin Hood foundation and funds both non-profit and for-profit organizations nearly equally that address economic inequalities in New York. Access to capital in low-income communities typically centers around the key ‚ÄúBasic Needs‚Äù of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy naturally as a key need for survival. As their portfolio companies thrive, wealth distribution drives more equitable distribution of these ‚ÄúBasic Needs‚Äù.\n\nWe‚Äôve only sampled a few above, but over the last few years there have been a lot of developments in this field including 2015 benchmarks compiled by GIIN and 2017 report on the financial performance of impact investment funds which highlight not just who these companies are, but also how they are performing. Short answer? They have been doing quite well and while these reports have the details ‚Äî these funds are feeling pretty good\n\n\nTLDR; Impact Investing comes in all shapes and sizes, but the ethos is still the same‚Äîmake a difference while making a return on investment. Much like we‚Äôve heard from founders of Doing Well by Doing Good companies, if the business doesn‚Äôt fundamentally work, the returns don‚Äôt work and business sustainability and social impact isn‚Äôt achieved.\n\nDo you have some thoughts about Impact Investing or ideas for topics or companies we should talk to? If so, we would love to hear them.

Most surprising, is that in the United States, 11.8% of households are food insecure as of 2018, and with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, that stat has nearly doubled.\nAs we‚Äôll learn in this podcast, hunger is a logistics problem not a scarcity problem, especially in the US, but also all across the world. In this podcast, we‚Äôre exploring a very direct way of solving the redistribution issue. We chat with Copia founder and CEO Komal Ahmad and explore how she came to solve this, and explore for the first time in our Podcast a Public Benefit Corporation structure and talk about how that plays into Doing Well by Doing Good differently than standard C-corp structures, like those of the companies we‚Äôve interviewed before.\nCheck out the full Podcast by clicking below or searching on your favorite Podcast application. Scroll down for the full transcript and topic-specific links.\n\n\nFounding Story\nAnand [0:46]: Alright, welcome Komal! Thanks for being here. So why don‚Äôt we just get started? How would you describe Copia in one line?\nKomal [0:57]: Thanks for having me! A technology company built to solve the world‚Äôs dumbest problem? Hunger\nAnand [1:03]: All right. And why are you solving that problem?\nKomal [1:07]: Because we waste 3x more food than there are mouths to feed. Because lack of food that‚Äôs the issue rather than ineffective distribution of that food. Because hunger in America is not a scarcity problem. It‚Äôs a logistics problem. So when I say that we‚Äôre solving the world‚Äôs dumbest problem ‚Äî hunger is dumb, not because it‚Äôs unfortunate, and it sucks. It‚Äôs dumb, because it shouldn‚Äôt exist, we have more than enough resources to feed everyone on the planet three times over. And that‚Äôs what makes it dumb.\nAnand [1:39]: That‚Äôs actually a pretty staggering step. So that sounds like a very big problem. So I‚Äôm actually curious, how did you get to this point? What was your founding journey? What made you solve this problem?\nKomal [1:51]: Yeah, sure. So candidly, it‚Äôs really surreal for me to even be here sharing my experiences today. You know, truth be told, I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be here. Let me explain. As, as a daughter of Pakistani immigrants, I had four very specific career paths laid out for me, an early age, doctor, lawyer, engineer, or a complete failure.\nAnand [2:18]: It was a great accent by the way.\nKomal [2:23]: Oh, it was years and years of practice. Let me tell you, my dream was to be a Bollywood actress. But as you‚Äôll come to find I ended up doing something far more realistic, like solving world hunger.\nKomal [2:34]: And so my journey began when I was a student at Berkeley, and I was walking down Telegraph Avenue when I encountered a homeless man was begging for food. Most people beg for money, but he was begging for food. And it really compelled me to stop and invite him to join me for lunch. And during lunch, he sat across from each wolfing down his food, so he was unbelievably hungry. It wasn‚Äôt a ploy for anything else. And in between bites, he shared a story. He said, my name is John, I just came back from my second tour in Iraq, I‚Äôve been waiting weeks for my military benefits to kick in. And because they haven‚Äôt, you know, I haven‚Äôt eaten in three days.\nKomal [3:16]: Well, this really hit home for me. This is a veteran, someone who would give the most selfless sacrifice for our country, only to come home to face yet another battle, that of hunger. And then adding insult to injury. Right across the street, Berkeley‚Äôs dining hall is throwing away thousands of pounds of perfectly edible food. And so it was this very stark reality of those who have and waste, and those who are in need and starve. And those two people right across the street from one another. And what I realized was that hunger isn‚Äôt just a sad, cruel and unfair problem. It is a dumb problem, and one that I can help to solve. And you know what I remember growing up being reminded by my parents. ‚ÄúEh Komal, don‚Äôt throw away your food, people are starving in Pakistan.‚Äù Of course, like what I discovered after my lunch with john, the veteran was that hunger is prevalent, not just in the poorest nations in the world. It‚Äôs everywhere. Even in Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest places on the planet, one and four don‚Äôt know where their next meal is coming from. Meanwhile, over 365 million pounds of perfectly edible food are wasted every single day. And to kind of wrap your head around that number. If you imagine the world‚Äôs largest football stadium filled to its absolute brim. Now with last night‚Äôs Pad Thai, or this morning‚Äôs Croissant. Untouched unopened perfectly edible food. That‚Äôs how much of it was wasted every single day in America. And this cost us over $218 billion every year. And if food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of methane after the US and China.\nKomal [5:00]: So there‚Äôs this massive economic costs, there‚Äôs a huge environmental impact, not to mention that some of the wealthiest cities in America, like I said before, one in four don‚Äôt know where their next meal is coming from. So clearly it‚Äôs not a lack of food. That‚Äôs the issue, rather an ineffective distribution about food, meaning that hunger is not a scarcity problem. It‚Äôs a logistics problem. And so resolving this disparity between excess and access, has become my life‚Äôs mission and Copia‚Äôs purpose. We‚Äôve built our platform to solve both hunger and food waste across America, and eventually, across the world.\nKomal [5:39]: And so, after my conversation with John, I marched right up to our dining hall manager, and I asked them, you know, what do you do with your excess food? They said, well, we try not to have any. And I said, well, how often does that actually work out for you? And after a lot of pushing and prodding, they finally admitted that they do have excess food, but they have to throw it away. And so I said, Well, why would you throw it away? When you go right across the street to people in People‚Äôs Park and donate it? And they said, because of liability? We don‚Äôt do that. I was like, yeah, you know, homeless, people‚Äôs high powered attorneys are standing by just to sue you. Like homeboy can‚Äôt afford a hamburger, somehow we can afford a litigator? What about you, we‚Äôre gonna sell this through to us 10 minutes ago at full price. So you‚Äôre saying 10 minutes ago, it was good enough for Berkeley students. And now 10 minutes later, it‚Äôs not good enough to feed people who are actually in need? Where is the logic? And I wasn‚Äôt gonna accept this answer naturally. So I did my own research. And I discovered that in 1996, President Clinton passed what is called the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan act. And it protects all corporations, organizations, individuals from any liability when they‚Äôre donating their perfectly edible food. In fact, in the past 24 years, the number of lawsuits or legal claims that have been filed against any business individual has been zero. But everyone and I mean, everyone and their mother has like a second cousin twice removed uncle‚Äôs hotel that shut down because they donated food. But in fact, that never happened. So I print this out and demand meeting with the executive director of our dining hall and I say, I want to start this food Donation Program, this is the right thing to do. Here‚Äôs all the protection. I can pretty persuasive when I need to be, and in less than 10 minutes, he agreed, and we went off to start one of the nation‚Äôs first Food Recovery organizations on a college campus, which was essentially students picking up food from our dining halls or on campus events, our stadium or arena and then redistributing that food directly to nonprofits?\nAnand [7:38]: So was that a nonprofit itself or was that Copia?\nKomal [7:41]: Yeah. It was a student organization. So that was what at the time was called Bear Abundance. Okay, because we were like, you know, the Golden Bears. So Bear / Bare. And yeah, and so it was just a student run organizations taking it directly to local nonprofits. And it was a great start. But just hugely inefficient. You know, I vividly remember one day our dining club manager calls and he‚Äôs like, ‚Äúhey, Komal, you know, no one came to this we have 500 gourmet sandwiches leftover. They need to be picked up in two hours or we‚Äôre going to throw then since we‚Äôll need fridge space. So do you want them?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYeah, I want them.‚Äù It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúGreat, come get it. You have two hours.‚Äù Mind you. I‚Äôm still sitting in class. And so I grabbed my bag, I dash across campus, I jumped into a Zipcar. I go through all these one way streets up to our loading dock, and begin loading this food into the trunk of my car. And it‚Äôs perishable foods as quickly as possible. And so I‚Äôm blasting the AC while he frantically tried to get these sandwiches in the trunk. And I finally do and I slammed the trunk. And I‚Äôm like, Phew thank God, this is amazing food. Of course, there‚Äôs going to be nonprofits that want it. Right. So then I proceeded to call 30 plus nonprofits in Berkeley, in Oakland, even as far as Richmond. Like, Hey, I have this amazing food, use it as 500 gourmet sandwiches, I‚Äôd like to donate Do you need them? A third of them don‚Äôt answer the phone. A third of them say no, we‚Äôre okay, we don‚Äôt need any more food today. Thanks. And then the last third, like Actually, you know what? We could use 10 sandwiches or 15 sandwiches. Like great. I have 485 sandwiches left. Yeah. What are you gonna do with those? Yeah, and I remember Seriously though, summoning my inner South Asian grandmother. I‚Äôm like eh you look so skinny. Take this food eat it to like random people on the street. Just like a crazy South Asian grandmother.\nAnd I just remember being pulled over the side of the road so frustrated. Why is it so hard to do a good thing? Why is it so hard to do the right thing? Where are these hungry people at? Like they‚Äôre freaking everywhere when we don‚Äôt have anything to give. And now when I have this amazing food to give them, they‚Äôre nowhere to be seen. And it was this frustration that was essentially the birth of my inspiration. Now I thought how much more effective, how much more efficient this whole process would be, if those who have food could say, hey, we have food, and those who needed food, hey, we could use that.\nAnand [10:08]: Cool, like a marketplace.\nKomal [10:10]: Yeah, exactly, just like a marketplace-matching food donors with nonprofits in need to clear the marketplace and instantly create value for both parties. So a win-win was really that simple.\nAnand [10:22]: Yep, and that was Copia.\nKomal [10:25]: That was the inspiration-the persperation behind the inspiration. Yeah. It wasn‚Äôt that simple to build. But that‚Äôs exactly what we built at Copia. You know, the first time ever, all businesses can easily and effectively redistribute any of their excess food to those who need it most. And our technology makes the whole process smarter and faster than ever before, with essentially web and mobile platforms that allow you to easily request pick ups of your surplus food, have it matched and then safely delivered to nonprofits in need, with a nationwide average delivery time of 26 minutes or less. And Copia is not a nonprofit. I know this sounds all touchy feely, really good for the world. And it is. That being said, we are a for-profit company that has built proprietary technology to solve both hunger and food waste across America, and eventually the world.\n\nMission and PBCs\nAnand [11:18]: Yep. Yeah, this is exactly why I‚Äôm glad to have you on the show. Because I think, the real premise here is Doing Well by Doing Good. Right for profit, something that can grow on its own, with its own profits. And not just a nonprofit, where you‚Äôre asking for grants, but you know, actually being able to grow at a fast rate. You know, that‚Äôs really the key. And if you can do that you can have much more impact. And we‚Äôll talk about that a little bit later. But I think, you know, you were talking just about how Copia got founded. What is your company mission? So what is the company mission? And how does being a PBC play into that?\nKomal [12:00]: Yeah, great question. You know, Copia‚Äôs mission is evolving. Our vision stays true. Right. So the ways in which we are feeding hungry people is continuing to evolve, depending on what our resources are, you know, and my whole goal was to feed hungry people, right? Whether it was like, as this crazed college student taking excess food from our cafeterias to now this founder of a technology company that has built this robust, proprietary, technical infrastructure that‚Äôs redistributing this highly perishable food, and matching it at warp-like speed to nonprofits that use it at that day, that time, that quantity of food, you know, so there‚Äôs a lot of - like we said before, it is a logistics problem, right? You have this high quality, incredible food, you‚Äôre- we‚Äôre talking globally over a trillion dollars of food, perfectly edible food is being wasted. And it is a significant amount of money. Getting this high quality perishable food, understanding with certainty, like who is in need of it, how to get that food packaged, and safely delivered. You know, which part of the supply chain because food waste occurs across the supply chain, from farms, to manufacturers, distributors, to households, to local restaurants. So for us, focusing, where do we work? Whose problem can we solve? And what we decided is the biggest problem, the most addressable problem that Copia itself, at this moment in time can solve is where $90 billion of food waste occurs, which is at food businesses, and then businesses with food. So food businesses like the Cheesecake Factory‚Äôs of the world, and the Whole Foods of the world, and then the businesses with food like San Francisco 49ers, Intel, HP.\nAnand [13:57]: Right, so then PBC. So then the PBC concept versus a standard C Corp. You know, the idea is, it‚Äôs for public benefit, which means that you‚Äôre for profit, you‚Äôre growing fast. But at the same time, you have a mission. Right. And and you can make sort of that choice at the right time to pursue that mission first versus profits? Or is it one and the same? I guess I just want to understand how that works.\n**Komal [14:22]: **\n\n‚Äú _ Yeah, so conventional wisdom says there‚Äôs a trade-off between social impact and economic performance. Beyond the very short-term, business actually profits from solving social problems and creating this shared value.‚Äù_\n\nThe shared value is created when we successfully achieve social value and economic value. At the same time, when we can find solutions that can do both that can generate a tremendous amount of wealth and successfully solve social problems, then we can actually address our social problems at massive scale. So in this whole process we ended up becoming Y-combinators first Public Benefit Corporation.\n\n‚ÄúA Public Benefit Corporation is a Delaware C Corporation. It is a legal entity that allows for both the high growth business model and a legally binding social mission. So we believe in doing so it sends a very clear message to our customers, to our partners, our nonprofits, our investors and the public at large. And that‚Äôs with it we say that you know, Copia is social mission as part of the legal foundation upon which our entire company stands.‚Äù\n\nAnd it also joins us to a global movement that challenges businesses to reconsider their role and their responsibility, and one that seeks to change what it means for a corporation to be considered successful. And so by combining the values of a social enterprise with the power of a for-profit business model, we strive to achieve both. And we use technology in business essentially, as a source for social good.\n\nDoing Well\nAnand [15:55]: That‚Äôs very cool. And yeah, that‚Äôs what I wanted to get to, which is when we talked about Doing Well and Doing Good. The first thing I wanted to focus on was the Doing Well part. From that perspective what makes your business sustainable in the short-term and long-term? And generally what is your business model?\n**Komal [16:15]: **Yeah. So for me and I would say not because I came up with the idea. But when Copia wins, everybody wins. And I think also to the TLDR of everything that I said above about a Public Benefit Corporation essentially no bullshit means is that if there was a business decision that I had to make, where one option would result in a tremendous amount of money being made at the cost of people being fed or food being diverted and waste being reduced. That if there was a time where I could make a lot more money, or I could create a lot more impact those two things were in opposition, I have the legal authority to make the decision which results in the company doing a tremendous amount more impact than it would financial returns, which seems almost antithetical to business. That is part of my fiduciary responsibility as an officer for Copia. What‚Äôs beautiful about this and not because I came up with it is that is that when Copia makes money, everybody wins. When we make money, it means we have recovered more food, we have diverted it from going to landfills, we have recovered more high quality food that is now being converted into high quality meals. For the communities in which we live, work, play. We are helping businesses capitalize on this food that they would have otherwise had to pay to throw away. We‚Äôre helping them to turn trash into cash. We‚Äôre helping the environment or helping nonprofits get more culturally diversified and more health-wise, appropriate low sodium, gluten-free options, kosher, etc. High quality meals. And in doing so these businesses have already produced this food, right? This is already going to go to waste. We‚Äôre not asking businesses to make more food, donate more food vis-vis by producing more food. All of this food waste occurs. What we‚Äôre saying is now use this really easy, this really intelligent solution to donate any of the inevitable excess that occurs. And in doing so, like you will be perpetuating and reinforcing this new business model this business model of the future, where it‚Äôs not about business, or impact or people or profits. It‚Äôs going to be about both. It goes from profit or impact to profit and impact.\n**Anand [18:39]: **That‚Äôs really powerful. Yeah, it makes sense. So in that case, then Copia is incentivizing everybody, both the companies that are donating the food as well as the nonprofits. Frankly, it‚Äôs a win-win because, you know, the companies are getting rid of their food and then I assume that Copia, you know, as the middleman in the marketplace, would then be making some profit off of each unit of food that‚Äôs being saved. Right. And that‚Äôs being donated and recovered.\n**Komal [19:10]: **Yeah, there are three different ways that we actually help businesses. And there‚Äôs three different revenue models that we also have at Copia. We help our food businesses further capitalize on their food donations. So even though we are a for profit, the end recipient of food donations is always a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which means that our customers food donations are tax deductible. We‚Äôve created this IRS compliant tax deduction automation processing platform that essentially has 8x the total amount of tax savings that are available now to businesses for food that they would have otherwise paid to throw away and also the total amount of food that we‚Äôve been able to recover. So that‚Äôs one part of it. Transparency is really important to copia. So we‚Äôve created this real time environmental and impact dashboard that our customers can access 24/7. So a glance it‚Äôll help them see, like, how much methane did they divert how much water did they conserve? How many pounds did they recover? How many people did they feed? Which nonprofits have they served? And both internal and external stakeholder engagement as well as this taxation automation processing solution. And now what we found is that the biggest actual economic benefit that both the business receives, the environment benefits from, as well as Copia benefits from, is when businesses actually are reducing the amount of food that‚Äôs being wasted. It sounds kind of counterintuitive. But in fact, we waste 3x more food than there are mouths to feed. And so we need these businesses to become more efficient. And so what Copia has done is we‚Äôve now invested in machine learning to develop predictive analytics that help businesses understand why is this waste happening? Right? Is it the Indian food station? Is the Chinese food station? Is it on Mondays? Is it on Fridays? Is it raining outside? Employees commuting to work, Fans going to a game? What is driving this excess, and then giving them the actionable insights they need to reduce over purchasing and overproduction? Knowing that they‚Äôre never going to get to zero, because it‚Äôs just built into our business models. But we can help them become more efficient, we can do so as a SaaS business, which is what we‚Äôve now become where we‚Äôre offering both improving purchasing and production decisions, and really helping businesses take control of their waste.\nAnand [21:33]: Yep. So is this SaaS revenue, as well as a per unit revenue?\n**Komal [21:42]: **Yeah, so we have pick-up costs. And additionally businesses pay us anywhere from 500 to 2200 a month to manage their entire food donation and to be their food donation solution. So to figure out what what‚Äôs being donated, what is that value of that? where is it going, getting the tax deduction receipt, and ensuring that doesn‚Äôt go wasted anywhere in the supply chain ensuring that that food is protected and safely delivered. So average delivery time is 30 minutes for Copia. We are going to feed 4 million people this year with incredible food that would have otherwise wasted. And the other part is we also want to help these businesses tell their story. We want to help them provide them with the customized marketing materials they need to showcase how their food is too good to be wasted. Yep, that they‚Äôve committed themselves to feeding people and not landfills. And so by providing photos, testimonials, along with access to PR opportunities that they can then leverage to engage with their customers and their employees. we‚Äôre enabling our customers, our businesses to save food, save money, save the environment, and of course, feed the hungry. So like I said, everyone wins with Copia. And this is all to say, though, yeah,\n\n‚ÄúCopia is more than just feeding the hungry, we want to save businesses money as we help them save the world. So we‚Äôre like Wonder Woman if she also had a degree in Corporate Accounting.‚Äù\n\n**Anand [23:08]: **So basically, you‚Äôre like the food recovery intelligence platform for all of these companies.\nKomal [23:16]: Yes. The overall vision is for Copia to become the world‚Äôs most effective and intelligent solution for the redistribution of surplus food. Overall, our vision is right now we‚Äôve developed all of these incredible, intelligent and sophisticated algorithms. And we‚Äôve created this real time marketplace, we‚Äôve created demand signaling, we understand what the need is like for 1000+ nonprofits all over North America. Now we know that we could use the same types of logistics, infrastructure, same types of algorithms, etc, to help move medicine, medical supplies, books, clothing technology, because it‚Äôs not a lack of any of these resources, it‚Äôs just an ineffective distribution of those resources. So the future of Copia to become the world‚Äôs most effective and efficient platform, the world‚Äôs most intelligent platform, for the redistribution of surplus resources, period. We‚Äôre just starting with the hardest one first.\n**Anand [24:10]: **And the World‚Äôs Dumbest Problem\n**Komal [24:13]: **The most fundamental need. Yeah.\n\nDoing Good\n**Anand [24:16]: **So you kind of touched on this already. When we talk about Doing Good, in 10 years when Copia is a huge success, what global challenge will you have helped solve. You touched on this already, but I want to just pose the question in case you want to say anything else about this.\n**Komal [24:33]: **Look, we waste 3x more food than there are mouths to feed. This cost us over a trillion dollars every year. If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of methane after the US and China. We cannot from a global economic, financial, public health perspective let this problem continue to exist. It is NOT sustainable. Regardless, we have to have a scalable solution to solve this problem. There have been an incredible plethora of nonprofits all over the world that have been trying to do some variation, some portion of what Copia is doing. Whether it‚Äôs food banks that are doing incredible work, whether it‚Äôs small Food Recovery organizations that are geographically constrained, they are doing this amazing work. And they are addressing the problem in their own right. Yeah, for me, for Copia, I‚Äôm not interested in addressing the problem, I‚Äôm interested in solving the problem.\n**Anand [25:36]: **Yeah that was actually my next question. Which is why this PBC? Why not a nonprofit? Why not maybe a profit organization and then just get a B Corp certification. Why not do it some other way? Why specifically this way?\n**Komal [25:54]: **\n\n‚ÄúThis is the future. Why should we have to defend a company and make it a nonprofit because it does something good in the world? Why can‚Äôt this be the future of business where businesses do good and they‚Äôre required to do good while they do well? And this is the way of the future.‚Äù\n\nI mean, you see companies like BlackRock that are no longer going to invest in any companies or firms that are not actually committed to a sustainably socially responsible future.\n**Anand [26:26]: **And it‚Äôs not the CSR either.\n**Komal [26:28]: **This is not CSR. This makes financial sense for you to do the right thing. That‚Äôs the whole point for Copia. Sure if you don‚Äôt care about hungry people, that‚Äôs one thing. But that‚Äôs fine but if you don‚Äôt care about like, food being wasted. That‚Äôs another thing. But like you sure as hell want to be able to make money, you sure as hell want to be able to save money. And frankly, in a time of COVID, where resources are still so expensive, and so scarce, in some cases, you cannot afford to just needlessly throw away food. And that‚Äôs also why we‚Äôre now, as we‚Äôve continued to evolve Copia‚Äôs technology and become this waste tracking software, we are now helping businesses understand, how can they become more efficient with their resources? How can we use these insights to grow their business? So that they can actually feed more people and feed more paying customers.\n**Anand [27:25]: **In many ways, you‚Äôre not just Doing Well by Doing Good in your own company, but you‚Äôre also helping your customers do that as well.\n**Komal [27:33]: **Yes, yes. And that‚Äôs on both sides of things, even our nonprofit partners who pay us to get the high quality food that they do. One of Copia‚Äôs core values is delivering with dignity. And that is something that‚Äôs so embedded even in our technology, so we have like a chain of custody in the entire process. So we know when the food is dumped, we know the amount of food and that type of food, the net value of the food. When was it package, when was it picked up by the driver, when did the driver scan in all the items? When they did they drop it off to the nonprofit? When did they scan it there? We have complete insight. So from a health and safety perspective too. What we also do is we provide all of our customers, all the food donors with these recyclable reusable Copia bags that can hold up to 50 pounds of food that our customers are putting this food into. And after that, they‚Äôll scan the QR code, they‚Äôll request to pick up and these bags are so great. They say we‚Äôre delivering with dignity. It says like ‚ÄúFill ‚Äòer up, Buttercup.‚Äù It‚Äôs these amazing bags are being delivered to the doorsteps of these nonprofit organizations. And it comes not as this curry spilling out of an Ikea bag. But it‚Äôs this real high quality meal that is delivered with dignity. It‚Äôs a gift. That‚Äôs a gift. It‚Äôs so important to me because I‚Äôm such a firm believer that today, it might be John, but tomorrow, it could be me. You know, it could be someone in my family, God forbid. It‚Äôs just, we need to treat people with respect. I don‚Äôt think that poor people need any more canned food. They‚Äôre like, I don‚Äôt know what the hell to do with canned food.\n**Anand [29:26]: **We don‚Äôt even know what to do with canned food. Right?\n**Komal [29:29]: **Exactly! So we need to up the respect in which we also provide resources. And so that‚Äôs another thing. So I think a lot of times people think because it‚Äôs leftover food. It‚Äôs like crap from people‚Äôs plates, but it‚Äôs not. Even when we partnered with the Super Bowl, we were their exclusive recovery partner. We recovered 14 tons of food which is 4x 16ft refrigerated trucks filled from top to bottom, not with popcorn or hotdogs, but Filet Mignon, lobster rolls, 300 cheeses, pulled pork sandwiches. I mean, not all my jam. I am a Muslim. So of course not really my jam, but incredible food for the 23,000 people that we fed that weekend. What&#039;s crazy is that it&#039;s because we are a for profit for good company that I can also with pride say we&#039;re going to feed 4 million people this year, mostly with incredible food that would have otherwise been wasted. While we do that we&#039;re going to be saving businesses and nonprofits over 21 million. And this is the future it‚Äôs not about just profit ‚Äî it‚Äôs profit, food, planet ‚Äî it is all of these things in one.\n\nCompany Culture and Values\n**Anand [30:41]: **Makes sense. And in terms of the company, I want to ask one question around your culture and you mentioned core values. What other core values do you have at Copia and how do you embody that not just in your customers and your end clients, but also your employees, and everybody that works at the company.\n**Komal [31:02]: **I have crawled through the pit fires of hell to even be sitting here on the other end, on the other line talking to you. So one thing that I‚Äôve really understood now in building Copia is that you have to, in the words of Les Brown, surround yourself with people who are unstoppable, unreasonable people who refuse to lead life as it is. Because they know that if change is going to happen, it‚Äôs up to them. People who believe what I believe not people who just want to like do something good in the world. I wasn‚Äôt born wanting to solve world hunger - that‚Äôs not what I mean. But people who believe that this is possible, that it‚Äôs not even just possible, it is necessary.\n\n‚ÄúSo at Copia we want everyone to have the attitude of gratitude, have genuine gratitude. Gratitude is contagious.‚Äù\n\nYou know our actions, our reactions, our communication, it expresses our gratitude and being grateful and sharing gratitude inspires and empowers others to do the same. It creates this echo chamber that radiates out of our business and does wonders to attract and retain the best, the brightest and the most generous around us. We want people to be genuinely hardy in their approbation and lavish with their praise.\n**Anand [32:24]: **Yeah, so positivity is kind of all around in order to have a positive feedback loop in that case?\n**Komal [32:29]: **It‚Äôs less positivity because feedback is important regardless. We want it straight no chaser. It‚Äôs not about positivity. And also even when I think about my own mindset. People are like you must be so optimistic. Positivity, optimism, pessimism, fuck that. I am hell bent, and God be my witness, I am hell bent on solving this problem. And that‚Äôs a very different reality. And that speaks to another one of Copia‚Äôs values, which is the importance of being more than passionate, but to be hungry. Passion alone is not enough, flames of passion can be extinguished when we confront the inevitable obstacles that come our way.\n\n‚ÄúWe must be more than passionate. We must be hungry. Passion is what gets you started. But it‚Äôs that hunger that keeps you going. Hunger is that insatiable drive that enables you to achieve something greater than yourself. It‚Äôs this unrelenting force that compels you to get up. Even after you‚Äôve fallen down 100 times before it means doing whatever you need to get the job done.‚Äù\n\n\nAdvice for Founders\n**Anand [33:42]: **Yeah, I was actually gonna ask you as a final question around advice for would-be founders who want to start a Doing Well by Doing Good company, or people that work at a Doing Well by Doing Good company like Copia. Sounds like you kind of gave some good advice already. But if you had any other advice, I‚Äôm sure people would enjoy hearing it.\n**Komal [34:04]: **Yeah. I mean, I think that one is like not everyone has to be an entrepreneur to do a tremendous amount of good. And you don‚Äôt have to be an entrepreneur to create something worthwhile in the world and to create change that is worthwhile in the world. Like none of these things are necessities. That being said, an entrepreneur is not something you half-ass is not something you whimsically decide to do. For me, for all intents and purposes, I didn‚Äôt even know how to spell entrepreneur when I became an entrepreneur. I was not one of these typical Silicon Valley dudes who was like I‚Äôm going to go start a startup. No, I wanted to solve a problem. I was training to be a doctor in the United States Navy. That was my destiny. This was not it. So there are a few things I would say. One is, I had planned out my entire life when I was 18. I was going to study Integrative Biology at Berkeley, I was going to become a doctor and try to be a doctor in the US Navy, I would find the love of my life, and I would marry them, I‚Äôd have my first kid after my first year residency, second kid after my final years of residency. All of this stuff, and now I recently turned 30. And turns out, I‚Äôm happily single, I don‚Äôt have any kids, and I am definitely not a doctor. The one thing I did do was fall in love it just wasn‚Äôt with a person, you know, but an idea, which sounds corny, but it is true. And so the lesson here for entrepreneurs, or for just people really is to write in pencil, and preferably one with a very big eraser. I had wanted to be a doctor for as long as I could remember, I was on that path. And yet it was this one random lunch with a hungry veteran that completely altered my life plan, and ultimately led me to finding my true purpose, my reason for being.\n\n‚ÄúSo you can make all the life plans you want. Just remember to not write them in permanent ink. Draw them up in pencil, where you can erase them, alter them, challenge and improve them as life unfolds.‚Äù\n\nBecause nobody, not even you, can predict who or where you‚Äôll end up being in even five years. Think about anyone in 2015, who was like, here‚Äôs where I see myself in 2020. Like, nearly 100% of those people were wrong. So that‚Äôs about passion being more than passion, being hungry. And then probably the last one, because we‚Äôre running short on time, is so many people on my journey, have said, come on Komal. How are you going to take leftover food and give it to poor people and somehow make money from that? That‚Äôs impossible! Like how are you going to dramatically reduce food waste? How are you gonna solve world hunger? Like all of this? This is insane. How cute little girl, what great ambition. And I remember being so upset when people would say that. And now I respond with the words of the late great Muhammad Ali. Impossible is a big word thrown around by small men who prefer to live in a world as it is, instead of using the power they have to challenge it, to change it, to improve it. Impossible is not a fact, it‚Äôs an opinion. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing. The Impossible does not exist, and it can no longer exist. We cannot tolerate a world where we waste 3x more food than there are mouths to feed. We will not tolerate it.\n**Anand [38:17]: **Wow, that‚Äôs very inspiring. There‚Äôs always going to be naysayers if you‚Äôre doing something worthwhile.\n**Komal [38:24]: **Yeah and for your audience, I hope you feel inspired. But I‚Äôm not here just to make you feel something. I‚Äôm here to get you to do something. So if you‚Äôre here today, if you‚Äôre listening in today, that means you care about doing good in some capacity in the world. And if you‚Äôre a human being you care about food, so whoever you are, whatever you do, Copia has a place for you. So whether you have excess food or you know someone who does or you want to invest in the future, or you just want to be part of this. With Copia, you can move the needle on hunger and food waste in America. So the question is, will you? One woman with a simple idea can make a world of a difference, but a group of people banded together can rid the world of an unnecessary and solvable problem-the World‚Äôs Dumbest Problem.\n**Anand [39:17]: **Well, that‚Äôs an amazing way to sign off. What an inspirational message. Yeah, thank you so much, again, for taking the time. I thought this was a really awesome conversation, and I really appreciate it.\n**Komal [39:30]: **Thank you. Yes. Thanks so much for having me.\n\nThanks for listening (or reading).

Hope you‚Äôre ready for weekend like this cool cat\n\nIn our last podcast, we explored a new concept: the Public Benefit Corporation or PBC, which is like a Delaware C-corporation, but with a legally-binding social mission.\nBut how does this differ from nonprofits? Or B-Corps? When it comes to Doing Well by Doing Good, why not just use any one of these constructs? What is the benefit of each and the cons in terms of making an OUTSIZED impact in the Doing Well by Doing Good model?\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôre going to do a crash course in each one of these and explain some of the key pros and cons. We‚Äôve purposely left out ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù entities like LLC‚Äôs and S-corps for this post, since there are a small percentage of high-growth companies structured that way ‚Äî but we can always come back to them in a later one üòÄ\n\nFirst let‚Äôs start with the basics. What‚Äôs the TLDR;?\n\n\nC-corp : the most common of for-profit corporate entity, otherwise known as a ‚ÄúGeneral for profit corporation‚Äù\n\n\nNonprofit : an organization not operating primarily to make a profit but instead one whose mission focuses on furthering a social cause or a shared goal and thus are tax-exempt as their profits are typically reinvested to cover operations. The IRS uses the 501(c) description, but there are many types of nonprofits.\n\n\nPublic Benefit Corporation (PBC) : this is legally a for-profit corporation, but has a moral obligation to take the high road in cases where profit comes in conflict with social impact.\n\n\nB-corp : this moniker is NOT a legal definition at all, but rather a certification awarded to a corporation establishing standards for social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency and is designated by the organization B Lab.\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper to explore each and their benefits and drawbacks.\n\nC corporations\nLet‚Äôs start first with the most common of these for-profit entities. Many startups tend to use the standard Delaware Incorporated C-Corp structure , which translates to a for-profit company that is subject to the Delaware law. For the full low-down you can read about it on Investopedia or catch the formal definition, which we‚Äôve copied below from CorpNet. Naturally, most of the Doing Well by Doing Good companies we profile and chat with also tend to be Delaware C corporations [If you‚Äôre interested here‚Äôs why?].\n\n‚ÄúThe C Corporation is the most common form of corporate entity. Also known as a ‚ÄúGeneral for profit corporation‚Äù, the C Corporation is owned by shareholders. The shareholders elect a board of directors to create and direct the high-level policies of the business.\n\n\n_ This Board of Directors then appoints corporate officers who in turn manage the day-to-day operations of the business._\n\n\n_ Please note: In most cases, ONE PERSON may act in all capacities. As a corporate formality, and as a good business practice, however, it is important to separate these roles and simply ‚Äúswitch hats‚Äù when necessary._\n\n\n_ Thus, shareholders generally have limited liability, even if they are involved in the day-to-day management while wearing the hat of employee or corporate officer._\n\n\n_ The shares of a corporation are freely transferable unless limited by agreement of the shareholders. The corporation exists indefinitely, unless and until it is dissolved. It is a separately taxable entity, meaning that it must file its own tax return and pay corporate taxes on its profits. There is no limit on the number of shareholders in a C Corporation.‚Äù_\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\nStandard structure means a lot of resources are available to help\n\n\nInvestors are more comfortable with it because of familiarity and previous successes\n\n\nTypically attracts the best talent due to the promise of monetary reward\n\n\nCons\n\n\nCan be overly driven by the need to grow at all costs, even if against the original mission\n\n\nConflicts may arise in the board room if money minded investors conflict with mission driven investors and senior leaders\n\n\n\nNonprofit\n501(c) Nonprofits typically are heavily dependent on donations and grants, which often track with markets since they are often a luxury item for many of the donors. That said, there are a few nonprofits which have, for various reasons, shown an ability for high growth, maximizing impact. At their core, nonprofits are created NOT for generating profits for shareholders, but rather are required to reinvest their profits back into the operating business.\nCheck out the full formal definition of a nonprofit from CorpNet . Naturally there are a number of different types of nonprofits, which you can read more about, but they all have overarching commonalities.\n\n‚ÄúFor those groups that are formed for charitable, educational, religious, literary or scientific purposes, and not for the purpose of generating profits for its shareholders, a special legal entity may be formed under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. A fully and properly qualified 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation has the following characteristics:\n\n\n_ The corporation is exempt from taxation._\n\n\n_ Tax-exempt corporations are prohibited from paying dividends._\n\n\n_ Upon dissolution, corporate assets must generally be distributed to another qualified nonprofit group._\n\n\n_ Significant filing requirements may exist at both the State and Federal level to establish and maintain tax-exempt status._\n\n\n_ A nonprofit may be prohibited from engaging in certain activities, including participating in political campaigns and substantial engagement in lobbying activities.‚Äù_\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\nClear mission drives the daily workings and there is no conflict of intention\n\n\nTax-exempt allows for more of the profits to be reinvested in the business to maximize impact of the organization\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNot a standard structure for high growth driving away risky investors\n\n\nFunding is a luxury expense for donors driven drastically by market conditions\n\n\nThe best talent may not be attracted to the opportunity due to low monetary rewards\n\n\n\nPublic Benefit Corporations (PBCs)\nPublic Benefit Corporations are a fairly new organization type started in 2010 in the US and are organized similar to a C-corp, however with a moral obligation to take the high road in cases where profit comes in conflict with social impact.\nAs we mentioned in our post on Social Enterprises, the Social Enterprise Alliance is a great source to define this type of social enterprise.\n\n‚ÄúA public benefit corporation is a legal incorporation available only in certain states that allows organizations to identify a purpose beyond maximizing shareholder value. Becoming a public benefit corporation ‚Äúprotects mission through capital raises and leadership changes, creates more flexibility when evaluating potential sale and liquidity options, and prepares businesses to lead a mission-driven life post-IPO,‚Äù according to benefitcorp.net. Public benefit corporation legislation varies from state to state. To learn more about becoming a public benefit corporation, click here: benefitcorp.net/businesses/how-become-benefit-corporation.‚Äù\n\nPros\n\n\nWorks similar to a Delaware C-corp allowing many of the resources to be just as helpful\n\n\nInvestors who are interested in making a profit and contributing to a social mission will decide to invest, reducing board level conflicts\n\n\nTypically attracts the best talent due to a similar monetary reward as C-corps\n\n\nCons\n\n\nInvestors not attracted to the social mission may be dissuaded due to the possibility of making decisions in conflict with making returns\n\n\nGrowth could be difficult as later stage investors will focus more on the numbers and have less of an appetite for social impact if in conflict with returns\n\n\n\nB corporations\nLike we said above, a B corporation is a certification rather than a legal entity. Think of B Corps like the following, companies banding together to come up with a common purpose despite being from different industries. The certification was created by B Lab, a non-profit third party organization created in 2007. The vast majority of these organizations tend to small and medium businesses, so typically not high growth.\nWe chatted about a similar concept in our first post  when we discussed the Pledge 1% movement, which we can think of a microcosm of the same phenomenon that spans both SMB markets and the Fortune 500, and can be made at any point in the company‚Äôs journey. B-corporations, similarly, are a certification that can be completed by a business anytime in their journey, after which B Lab will keep tabs on their social impact through the third-party B Lab organization.\nMany large Fortune 500 companies, in addition to the Pledge 1% movement tend to use methodologies outside of the B corporation by banding together and making pledges like this one.\nAlthough, in recent years there has been more of a shift and larger companies, including public ones, like Lemonade, who recently went public, have begun to use the B corporation moniker to formalize their positive work. You can see their recent assessment by B Lab here, to better understand how B Lab keeps tabs on organizations.\nSo what is the the B corporation formally? Well let‚Äôs let the B Lab speak for itself:\n\n‚ÄúCertified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps are accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.\n_ Society‚Äôs most challenging problems cannot be solved by government and nonprofits alone. The B Corp community works toward reduced inequality, lower levels of poverty, a healthier environment, stronger communities, and the creation of more high quality jobs with dignity and purpose. By harnessing the power of business, B Corps use profits and growth as a means to a greater end: positive impact for their employees, communities, and the environment._\n_ B Corps form a community of leaders and drive a global movement of people using business as a force for good. The values and aspirations of the B Corp community are embedded in the B Corp Declaration of Interdependence.‚Äù_\n\nLike we discussed in our post on Social Enterprise, the Social Enterprise Alliance also extends this to explain how they fit into the construct of ‚Äú Social Enterprise ‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúA B Corp, on the other hand, is an organization that has successfully completed the certification put forth by the nonprofit B Labs. B Corps can only be for-profit organizations, and they must meet B Labs‚Äô standards for social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. The B Corp certification is a distinction for social responsibility, much like fair trade or organic. Though for-profit social enterprises can apply for B Corp certification, B Corps don‚Äôt necessarily have to be social enterprises.‚Äù\n\nPros\n\n\nFormalized score assessing standards for social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency completed by a third party non-profit organization\n\n\nOngoing check keeps the company in line their impact goals through public disclosure\n\n\nDoes not impact the formal structure of the organization in any official capacity, so can be implemented at any time.\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNot widely adopted amongst the Fortune 500\n\n\nNot a formal legal distinction, but rather a certification, so can be temporary and not necessarily tied to profits\n\n\n\nHow do these fit within Doing Well by Doing Good?\nWhen we think of Doing Well by Doing Good, **we think of a high-growth company which creates a product or service that directly contributes to positive good in the world from Day 1. So how do these different mechanisms play into that? **\nThe main takeaway is the structure of the company is purely a reflection of the founder‚Äôs intention. After all, you could decide to have a C-corp initially and file for a B-corp certification later, or you could start as a PBC but ultimately switch over to a C-corp. The list could go on.\n\nSo far, we have found most DWDG companies to be Delaware C corporations and a handful of PBCs.\n\nBut there is no one best way to Do Well by Doing Good, and even if there might be one today, it‚Äôll likely change in the future.\nHigh growth businesses need to have an incentive to continue to grow. The common understanding of capitalism is that the incentive of money is enough to drive most businesses, and has been throughout history, but just as humans evolve, so too is capitalism.\n\n_ Our key hypotheses is that the drive to make a difference is more sustainable than a drive to make more money, because money doesn‚Äôt have an end. So because DWDG companies are incentivized by their commitment to increase social impact rather than purely profit, they are more sustainable in the long run._\n\nThrough our exploration and interviews, we‚Äôll continue to use examples of companies today to extract common themes and share them along the way.\nIf there‚Äôs anything you can take from this post, it‚Äôs that high-growth DWDG businesses have many ways of being formed, and if you‚Äôre looking to start one, there are a number of approaches to take.\n\n\nThanks for reading! While we‚Äôve looked into C-corps and dabbled into PBCs, we‚Äôre excited to take more time to explore other for-profit models (and sometimes nonprofit models) which have achieved high-growth.

Hope this morning has got you feeling something like this.\n\nAnother week, another fresh perspective on Doing Well by Doing Good. This time we‚Äôre chatting with CEO of Series B climatech company One Concern , **Ahmad Wani , **with a focus on building planetary scale resilience. In this episode, we touch upon the journey so far , the mission / culture dynamic , making money and shareholder value , making a positive social change, and of course advice for the listeners.\nFull Disclosure: I currently (and proudly) work at this company for many of the reasons we discuss in this post and this company served as my initial inspiration for this newsletter.\nCheck out the links below, or subscribe and find it in your favorite podcast service. If you‚Äôre more of the reading type, check out the transcript below with links to each segment (along with a quick TLDR; on the top if you‚Äôve only got a few minutes).\n\n\nTLDR;\n\n\nJourney : Much like other DWDG companies we profiled, One Concern thought about being a nonprofit, but decided the nonprofit could not achieve a global mission the way a for-profit could by attracting investment, talent, and partners.\n\n\nMission : One Concern‚Äôs mission is planetary scale resilience and at One Concern, as in other mission-driven social enterprises, mission and culture go hand-in-hand, where mission is driven by culture and visa-versa in a virtuous cycle.\n\n\nDoing Well : One Concern makes money through software subscription revenue and transactional revenue as the maintainer of a marketplace for climate related solutions.\n\n\nShareholder Value : Ahmad shares how climate change affects us everyday and disproportionately affects marginalized communities, but sustainability needs a business model to be ‚Äî shall we say ‚Äî sustainable. The market is large providing direct shareholder value for One Concern, meaning that making money and achieving the mission are intertwined.\n\n\nDoing Good : One Concern aims to leverage that business model to incentivize the right capital investment to bridge the gap between marginalized communities and well-off ones.\n\n\nAdvice for Listeners: Ahmad advises prospective founders of DWDG companies to surround themselves with people who give honest feedback and push you to be better. And for professionals, finding the perfect combo of what you care for, what you‚Äôre good at, and what you enjoy doing.\n\n\n\nFounding Journey\nAnand 0:29 So why don‚Äôt we just jump right in. Tell us a little bit about your founding journey. How did you get to where you are today?\n**Ahmad 0:37 **Okay, so I‚Äôm an entrepreneur by complete accident. And I came to the United States to pursue my Master‚Äôs and PhD in something called Earthquake Engineering, which is a real field. And One Concern was kind of my future PhD project. And me and my colleagues, Nicole, and Tim, ended up starting this full time as a company. And it was a complete accident that I was visiting back home and I got caught in a flood where I happened to be one of the lucky ones to survive and tell the story. But really, it kind of opened my eyes in terms of a the global nature of how disasters really cripple societies and economies. And then also the opportunity, which lies ahead of us, especially with the advent of digital and AI.\n**Anand 1:39 **What advice did you get along the way? Any resources that help you what challenge? What were the major challenges that you faced up until this point?\n**Ahmad 1:49 ** Oh, that‚Äôs an interesting question. At this point, okay. I think every day there are so many challenges. So let me break them down a little bit. So, before founding the company, you need to be convinced that you are good enough, and the idea is good enough. And then you know, you have an Indian background, so you have to have the ability to call your parents and convince them that you‚Äôre not going to get a PhD from Stanford, but instead you go rogue.\nAnand 2:24 That‚Äôs a tough one.\n**Ahmad 2:29 ** Right, exactly. So, but that was a that was a big hurdle. But when we when we did get started, I feel we‚Äôre not in a very traditional market. My initial instinct was the people, when I was on that rooftop in Kashmir trying to trying to figure out whether I can live or die in this flood in 2014, I was seeing these helicopters. You‚Äôre trying to rescue people. So my initial instinct was governments are going to be the primary user. So my initial pitch deck was focused on Gov tech, and governments being the only user. And so I distinctly remember a meeting where the venture capitalist, a very respected one who ended the meeting in need about four and a half to five minutes, and quite literally threw us out of the office. And so as soon as I used to utter the word, earthquake, or disasters and government, they used to basically say you are a disaster, and please leave. And there is no business and there is no market. So I feel like initially figuring out and getting the right set of people to believe in the vision and the mission was key. So that was I feel a big hurdle.\n\nMission and Culture\nAnand 3:51 All right. Yeah. Well, I think that‚Äôs a great segue into the next question, because I know it sounds a bit silly coming coming from me, obviously, I work at the company. But what is One Concern‚Äôs mission?\n**Ahmad 4:05 **One Concern‚Äôs mission is to make disasters less disastrous. The way we plan to do that is by what we call as planetary scale resilience with three lenses of safety, sustainability and equity. Fundamentally, what we believe is that in the advent of an ever changing world, we are now witnessing one of the biggest disruptions the world has ever seen. COVID-19. And we are going to witness even more ramifications of climate change, which is a chronic stress which the world is now undergoing and is going to continue to undergo in the next few decades. We feel that there is an ability for, for One Concern, to be able to educate the end users, whether it‚Äôs private companies, whether it‚Äôs cities, or whether it‚Äôs somebody walking on the road, to be able to understand what it means for them, for their business, for their city, for their livelihoods, for their safety, and how can they then take the necessary actions to get ahead of that disruption and all that risk?\n**Anand 5:16 **Okay. And so, and we‚Äôll get to this a little bit later into the Doing Well, and Doing Good part of the podcast. But sticking on the mission part, how do you create a culture that embodies that mission everyday?\n**Ahmad 5:32 ** I think it‚Äôs getting to live your mission everyday, of course, right? And it starts with people. So you need to be able to surround yourself with the right people and making sure that you‚Äôre able to clearly communicate what your core values are. Now, a big part of what we do is trust and building trust with our customers. Because the systems which we provide can have huge and far reaching implications on their short term, but as well as on their long term decision making, which can affect both their business but also their safety. So we want to be able to embody, for example, a mission of being intellectually honest and embodying trust in our systems. And that is just one of the many things where the core values, which we embody, can have far reaching implications to the customer, and the decisions which they make. So I feel it starts by sort of having a set of clearly defined core values, which are aligned with your product with your market with really what you‚Äôre trying to do in terms of your mission. And really making sure that you have a clear set of communication, as well as accountability, to make sure that your team members live by those core values.\n**Anand 7:04 ** Right. And so in that case, these are the core values that you look for in candidates and in partners, and people that that you work with, as a whole.\n**Ahmad 7:15 **\nYes, I feel to be honest, COVID-19 has put a mirror in front of all of us, and our core values. And really, the focus on people and customers is going to be more important than ever. I feel like that the last few weeks to months, has clearly shown how it‚Äôs not necessarily that the tech companies lack some of these core values in the way they operate whether it‚Äôs inequity, whether it‚Äôs lack of diversity, but I feel tech companies might be the inequity creating machines, or industries where inequity actually is created. So I feel it is our responsibility to really hold a mirror in front of ourselves, and really take a deeper look, in terms of how do we actually operationalize these core values, because everybody has core values, but only a few companies are able to sort of really deeply operationalize them. And recruiting is one of the areas that we can operationalize it. Performance goals is another way you could actually operationalize that.\n**Anand 8:36 **Like making sure that performance goals aligned with the mission. And then making sure that that continues.\n**Ahmad 8:42 **Yeah, I mean, open question like how many companies do you know where your variable comp is actually tied to you actually, adhering to some of these core values. Whether your team feels that you are actually a good manager, and you are exemplifying some of the core values which are written on the walls, I don‚Äôt know of many companies who are actually trying to do that. I would like for One Concern to be doing that.\n**Anand 9:14 **Make sense. So then embodying it requires operationalization. And by operationalizing it you can then embody that mission continually.\n**Ahmad 9:23 **Right! You need to put the money where your mouth is right? Like, actually, the core value would rather start by operationalizing them and it starts from the people within, then you can figure out how to operationalize them with your customers and the broader set of stakeholders, thought leadership. I feel that‚Äôs secondary. First we need to end up fix our shops because I feel technology might be a big cause of these inequities.\n**Anand 9:53 **Yep. Yeah. I know we could go on we can go on forever on this.\n**Ahmad 9:59 ** Might be an unpopular opinion but that‚Äôs the opinion I have.\n**Anand 10:06 **One thing that just stood out to me was, being an employee at One Concern, I think one thing that stands out to me is being resilient. Right? And right now, during COVID, being resilient is such a big part of every single thing we do, right? I mean, if we‚Äôre not resilient, we won‚Äôt be able to survive, we won‚Äôt be able to get through life. And so that‚Äôs one of the values that certainly I hold very dear. And I know that that‚Äôs one of the examples where you say, here‚Äôs the mission of the company, which is to be resilient, and planetary scale resilience, but then kind of flipping it and saying, okay, now how do we embody it? Well, we embody it as people by being resilient. And this time, especially during COVID, it‚Äôs more important than ever.\n**Ahmad 10:47 **Absolutely, I mean, like any other company at our stage, we‚Äôre trying to right now figure out our ‚Äúremote strategy‚Äù. An easy option could be, hey, we are at the behest of the San Mateo Health Department. So let‚Äôs extend the three months, and then another two months and another three months, until we feel convinced that we can go back to the office. But if you think about it, from a resiliency standpoint, we might want to actually figure out like, hey, if there is a, forget COVID-19, but what if there is a COVID-2021 you‚Äôre gonna be still down on our knees and locked in our homes, with safety, but also psychosocial implications on our team and our customers. So, getting ahead of it would really entail thinking about how do you now set up processes that, number one, help you get back on your feet as it relates to reopening, but then also make sure that going forward, and you‚Äôre not backward looking. But now you are foreseeing some of the different things which could happen in terms of disrupting your workforce, and coming up with a with a remote work strategy would therefore require us to first be resilient as a company, and then profess the mission of resiliency more broadly.\n**Anand 12:13 ** Yep. So it‚Äôs like, each individual is resilient, then the company becomes resilient, then we can make other people resilient.\n**Ahmad 12:19 ** Right, then we can claim to make other people resilient.\n\nDoing Well and Shareholder Value\n**Anand 12:23 **All right. Cool. Well, I think we can move on to another part, which is, again, the podcast is Doing Well, by Doing Good. And so we‚Äôll start actually with Doing Well. So, you know, One Concern is a venture backed business. And so, one question that I always ask is, what makes the business of One Concern sustainable, both in the short term and long term? And what is the business model?\n**Ahmad 12:50 ** So One Concern‚Äôs business model is being able to sell what we call as resilience as a service software or solutions to end users or owners of the risk. The risk, which we measure is called business interruption risk or business resiliency. And the owners could be anybody, like the City of Seattle, or the Government of this Western Japan city called Kumamoto, or it could be a large Fortune 10 oil company.\nAnand 13:24 And so in terms of making money, you would be selling a software product. And then, is there any other revenue stream or another way that One Concern would make money?\n**Ahmad 13:37 **So One Concern creates both supply side systems as well as envisions creating sort of demand side systems. So we basically are able to not just be a part of the problem by pointing out all the flaws an enterprise has, but also help them sort of partner with the necessary folks who can actually help them become more resilient.\n**Anand 13:59 **Right. Okay. So then in that case, it would be definitely subscription revenue, but also perhaps transactional revenue that you can get from being part of the supply and demand side. Okay, that makes sense. As a next step, then, how do you balance shareholder value with your mission and culture because naturally, you are a venture backed business looking to grow and make money?\nAhmad 14:27 So there‚Äôs a few things, so I‚Äôm kind of thinking while I‚Äôm speaking, so please excuse me. If we wanted to be a nonprofit, and take that route, and sort of raise venture capital, I feel we could still execute on the same problem set. But we will be able to sort of make Palo Alto resilient rather than the world resilient. And that‚Äôs not necessarily our mission. Because you feel like this problem is very, very global, and very much so affects different communities around the world. And so just solving it for a particular location or a particular community is not necessarily the end game for One Concern. And so maybe there is an app, which might be specifically suited to like high schoolers in California or something like that, it would be great in terms of monetizing a particular vertical, a particular location, but our mission is more global. And so we need to take that mindset. And what I found was, in order for us to be able to actually scale this globally, and thereby serve our mission, we have no other option, but to raise money, and actually figure out business model. Now there‚Äôs another perspective, which is, I feel that if you look at the different things which I could be doing, right, I could be working on, let‚Äôs say, five problems right now. And I‚Äôve chosen one of them, which is solving this issue of AI natural disasters, resiliency, in this space, but could work in other things. I feel like, if you look at the basic needs in Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy. For many of, and those keep changing the COVID is kind of all these things, but fundamentally, I feel that for some of those things, we are further ahead, but for certain others, we are still lagging behind. And if you are focused on technology to be able to better provide those services more broadly, across the world, there can be very, very lucrative businesses that could be built. So I feel like you don‚Äôt even have to actually validate your problem statement. Because the problem statement is like, these many people die of hunger every day, and these people don‚Äôt have access to power or water or internet. So I feel like you have a much higher probability of success, if you are a mission-driven company, a) from the standpoint of having a validated problem statement, which is being approached by century old methods. And now we have the luxury of internet and technology and data, digital, etc, which gives us a unique ability to maybe look at it slightly differently. The second aspect is, if you are mission-driven company, you are able to, because the part of startups is being able to attract the right set of people to work on this. You‚Äôre able to attract, like an A team and that really I feel increases your odds of of success. I feel because of those reasons, I feel we have a better hit that success rather than a different company.\n**Anand 18:20 **So shareholders see eye-to-eye because the success of the company is actually driven by the fact that it‚Äôs mission driven, as opposed to being hindered by it.\n**Ahmad 18:30 **Correct, being mission driven is not like an afterthought for us. It‚Äôs not like, Oh, you know, we are kind of doing this. But now let‚Äôs actually give 20 hours of our time, or $20,000 as a donation to some other organization, and then let‚Äôs figure out whether their mission aligns with One Concern. I mean, we can do that. And we do that sometimes. But of course, more importantly, our day-to-day in advancing our mission is fulfilling that social good element, and so therefore, I feel like there right now completely aligned, shareholder value as well as doing good.\n\nDoing Good\n**Anand 19:12 **Yeah, and I like that you brought up Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy. Because, you know, one interesting point I‚Äôve always thought about in Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy is the bottom part is the biggest, right, the basic needs are actually the most important. So when investors talk about TAM or total addressable market, I mean, that is it, right? You have a larger addressable market. Now, of course, there‚Äôs the argument that well, do people have the money, but it turns out, if you can find where the money is, that market can be very large. And so you‚Äôre doing good, and you‚Äôre also addressing a big need, which means that you have a large market. You actually touched upon a lot of the a couple of questions that I was going to get to anyway, so I‚Äôm glad you talked about it, because the next part of it is Doing Good. My basic question is always this: in 10 years, right when One Concern is a huge success, what global challenge will you have helped solve?\n**Ahmad 20:04 ** I think the world needs a bunch of money to adapt to climate change, and I feel One Concern would have played a tangible role in that. I feel that, fundamentally, the climate movement needs a business model. In many situations that doesn‚Äôt exist. And I feel One Concern provides that business model, we have seen in our analyses, that when we simulate these cities, and how disasters impact cities or companies, we‚Äôre able to see how the interconnected nature of of economies of cities and how much of your risk actually comes from your people getting affected from the broader community getting affected, and by the public infrastructure getting affected. I feel public infrastructure is, in the US and more even globally is, is currently in a very bad crumbling state. And it requires immediate upgrades. And I think, given we are in such huge fiscal deficit, there needs to be a business model to show returns to be able to fund that and adapt to climate change. And I feel One Concern‚Äôs modeling is able to do that.\n**Anand 21:36 **Makes sense. So then, you touched on this already, but I just want to make sure that I got this right, because my next question is, why build a for profit versus a nonprofit? And you talked about it a little bit, you talked about growth, you talked about, you know, you can go faster, you can actually have a huge market. If somebody were to choose, right, okay, nonprofit, and I‚Äôm sure at some point, you probably thought about this. So did you and your co founders have to go through, did you guys have to go through this process of saying, should this be a nonprofit versus not? And at that time, how did you make that call?\nAhmad 22:10 That‚Äôs a good question. I think, as I mentioned previously, we were initially thinking that maybe we can be a nonprofit. We later realized that the only way to achieve our mission, which is planetary scale resiliency, is to be a for-profit company, because otherwise, we‚Äôre going to end up with a resilient Palo Alto, rather than a resilient world. And then we‚Äôll only be able to fund the wealthy cities. So that‚Äôs, I think, the biggest realization which we had is scaling the company at a pace we really feel is urgent, given the climate crisis at the scale we want, which is global, is necessary for a company to achieve its mission. And, fundamentally, the problem is we‚Äôre trying to solve, as I said, is sustainability needs a business model and One Concern, helps show that business model and expose that out in the open. So I feel that‚Äôs really something which I would feel proud looking back, if you‚Äôre able to achieve that.\n**Anand 23:22 **Yeah and you mentioned this, which is interesting, because you say that One Concern achieves business model for sustainability. But to your point if it‚Äôs also in some ways, kind of helping with wealth inequality, a lot of the issues in sustainability is that there is a lot of money maybe in Palo Alto, but not as much money in a place like, let‚Äôs say, Dhaka, Bangladesh, for example. And so the idea is, that doesn‚Äôt mean that money can‚Äôt be used in order to help people right in other parts of the world. And so if you can build a business model, then perhaps you can actually help with some of that inequality, right, the wealth inequality that exists and help solve some of those fundamental problems in places where they may not have the means to do it themselves.\n**Ahmad 24:08 **I mean, we don‚Äôt even have to go that far. Actually, we can just go to Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.\n**Anand 24:14 ** That‚Äôs true. Yeah.\n**Ahmad 24:16 **You can kind of see the inequality. I mean, I was educated by one of the council members here. The local council meant that more than 50% of students are some of the school districts in in East Palo Alto do not eat two times a day, and they‚Äôre homeless. And you know, that‚Äôs shocking, because it‚Äôs like a few miles from one of the more wealthy neighborhoods. Now, if one person is able to show how an infrastructure upgrade in East Palo Alto, leading to the Dumbarton bridge is able to create business value for let‚Äôs say, businesses in Palo Alto as well as in the broader Silicon Valley, in terms of making sure that they have a more resilient business and a more resilient workforce, we could actually solve that issue for East Palo Alto, in terms of their education systems, or their infrastructure being in shambles.\n\nAdvice for Listeners\nAnand 25:21 Yeah. Wow, yeah, that‚Äôs that‚Äôs a good point. All right. Well, thank you for that. That‚Äôs, that‚Äôs very helpful. You know, I think this is a perfect opportunity now to move on to advice for the listeners. So you‚Äôve shared a lot about your story about how you‚Äôve gotten to where you are, why you do what you do. Now, what advice would you give to either founders trying to build a Doing Well by Doing Good company, or professionals that are looking to work for one?\nAhmad 25:50 I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm the right person to take advice from.\nAnand 25:54 Well, whether somebody takes it or not, is a different story. But I‚Äôm sure people would love to hear your thoughts.\nAhmad 26:02 Haha that‚Äôs true. I think that when you‚Äôre starting any company, I feel like there are many instances when, you know, because every day is not happy. And it‚Äôs like two steps forward, and one step back and you‚Äôre constantly doing that. And so there are several instances when you are about to give up. So I feel persistence, is key. And having, you know, belief in your mission is important, because if it was so obvious to everyone, then everybody would do it. And so sometimes, you know, these things don‚Äôt make rational sense or logical sense even. I realized, because, we can only see a few steps ahead, the human brain, but sometimes things happen in the future, which really delight you, outside your comprehension. So, the one support system, which has really worked for me is making sure that you are able to surround yourselves with the right people. The people who can tell you the good, bad, and the ugly, the people who believe in your mission in you as an individual. And sometimes maybe they tell you, you know, you‚Äôre not the right person so step aside, sometimes they give you that much needed push, which you need, in that time of despair. And these set of people, you need to know who to go to for what advice, because most of the times, you get the wrong advice or suboptimal advice because you‚Äôre just asking the wrong person. That I realized like three years into the journey, I and I think this could be your investors, this could be your board members, your advisors, your team members, but I think all of it starts from your co-founder. And sometimes it‚Äôs almost weird. You know, I‚Äôve been so blessed with having Nicole and Tim as my co-founders. Because in the early days, I still remember that there have been times. And I know, there have been times when I was like, I don‚Äôt know whether this is going to work, but I‚Äôm still going to try because I can‚Äôt let Nicole down. Right. And it was primarily that reason that I pushed a little more. And then I was like, oh, okay, this actually works. So I feel like surrounding yourself with the right people is one of the most important things that you can do as a founder.\n**Anand 28:50 ** Awesome. Yeah. That‚Äôs, that‚Äôs great advice. And how about for professionals? So let‚Äôs say that, you know, somebody says I, you know, founding a company is a little bit difficult, but how about working for a company that Does Well by Doing Good?\n**Ahmad 29:05 **Okay. I think that many companies are trying to do good in their own ways, of course. And I feel many companies who have gone on to become very successful have had that strong mission and vision of democratizing big pieces of that Maslow‚Äôs triangle. So, I feel when you‚Äôre trying to figure out where you want to work next. Let me think about how would I do that?\nAnand 29:40 I would say it‚Äôs been a while, I guess.\n**Ahmad 29:44 ** Yeah. So I think what I would do is I would try to figure out what are the problems that I really care for. Problems I care for, as in what the world needs? Assemble all the problems and which are the ones the world urgently needs solved? Then figure out which part of what subset of those problems am I good at solving? Or could I be potentially be good at solving or adding tangible value to? And then third, what would I enjoy doing? And I feel I would try to work at the intersection of those three things. I would try to figure out what are the causes I really care for? What am I really good at? And then what would I enjoy doing because working in a company which is trying to do good, it‚Äôs, you know, maybe it‚Äôs in its infancy, so it‚Äôs going to be a hard journey. So as much as you believe in the mission and vision, and you‚Äôre pretty good at working at whatever you do, you also need to sign up for a long term commitment. So you need to really enjoy that journey. So I feel those are the three things which I would just ask people to think about.\n**Anand 31:17 **Wow, that‚Äôs great advice. And with that thank you again for being on the show and sharing your story.\n**Ahmad 31:24 **Thank you so much for having me.\n\nThanks for listening and reading, whether you got through the TLDR; or the entire thing, I hope you learned a thing or two üòÄ.

Welcome to 2021 ‚Äî It‚Äôs been a crazy start already, from poor accountability, an attempted coup to a shift in power.\n\nIn this post, I wanted to backtrack to what may seem like a lifetime ago ‚Äî December 2020. Two of the hottest tech IPOs DoorDash [DASH](finance.yahoo.com/quote/DASH/)] and [Airbnb](www.investors.com/news/technology/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-abnb-doordash/) [[ABNB] have been the talk of the town.\nWhile neither have made much for public market investors post IPO yet, they have already made billions for all of the private market investors lucky enough to get into their early rounds.\nI felt compelled to write about these 2 companies, not because they have generated a lot of money for investors, though that certainly qualifies them as Doing Well , but to explore what Doing Good means for them, and if we can quantify what their positive impact has been.\nTraditionally DoorDash and Airbnb don‚Äôt fit our definition of Doing Well by Doing Good as mentioned in our original post since their service doesn‚Äôt directly contribute to Doing Good. Here‚Äôs our original definition for reference.\n\n_ Doing Well by Doing Good is a concept characterized by for-profit companies that creatively tie in capital incentives through products and services that directly feed into immediate good for society from Day 1. These companies are a subset of those described above, but are differentiated by their ability to tie closer to 100% of their operating revenue to contribute towards Doing Good rather than a fraction like many of the other companies mentioned above._\n\nThat said, it‚Äôs still important to acknowledge the positive impacts companies like DoorDash and Airbnb have on populations vulnerable due to unstable income (e.g. gig workers unable to find other work, home owners struggling to make mortgage payments, etc).\nFirst we‚Äôll discuss what people are saying and then go into quantifying the impact these companies are having on vulnerable populations , and finally comparing this to the value generated for shareholders (those outside of the vulnerable populations).\nThe Hullabaloo\nWith their IPOs, Twitter and the world has blown up with the usual Silicon Valley big wigs, Investors, and even local officials weighing in.

Here‚Äôs how he can help revive San FranciscoSan Francisco‚Äôs legions of newly minted millionaires and billionaires after last week‚Äôs IPOs should help rescue the city as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.[3:18 PM ‚àô Dec 15, 2020\n\n618Likes92Retweets](twitter.com/hknightsf/status/1338866041271644168)\nAccording to DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, ‚ÄúHelping brick-and-mortar businesses compete, succeed, and flourish in these rapidly changing times is the core problem we are trying to solve.‚Äù\nAs for Airbnb , investors and key stakeholders, like Paul Graham, have been ecstatic with their financial results, but others like Heather Knight aren‚Äôt so thrilled and academic pundits like HBR  [full paper here] have shown that a 1% increase in Airbnb listings lead to an 0.018% increase in rents and a 0.026% increase in house prices with US data up to 2018.\nCertainly benefits may well be present for both DoorDash and Airbnb , but do they outweigh the costs? How does helping the 1% counteract the positive impact to these vulnerable populations? These are some questions we aim to answer.\n\nShow Me the Numbers (2020)\nAccording to their S-1 filing, DoorDash in the first 9 months of 2020 had the following key numbers\n\n\n$1.92B revenue\n\n\n$149M loss\n\n\n$229M worth in free cash flow\n\n\nAnd the key constituents as see in this ‚ÄúFlywheel‚Äù diagram below amounted to the following\n\n\n18M Consumers\n\n\n1M ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù\n\n\n390,000 Merchants\n\n\n\nDoorDash has shown some strong numbers, according to most pundits, but how do we split this value between the vulnerable populations who need this revenue to survive vs. the 1%? For the sake of argument let‚Äôs categorize DoorDash‚Äôs stakeholders into two categories:\n\n\n_ Value to 1% :_ Consumers, Large shareholders (e.g. investors, founders, etc)\n\n\nSocial Good : Merchants (e.g. small businesses) and ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù (e.g. gig workers)\n\n\n\nWhat about Airbnb? Similarly their S1 filing shared some promising results despite severe downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first 9 months of 2020, they reported\n\n\n$2.52B revenue\n\n\n$697M loss\n\n\nAs for some statistics on the supply side:\n\n\n4M+ hosts\n\n\n5.6M active listings\n\n\nBut Airbnb is a bit different, because the vast majority of renters are using it as supplemental income rather than a primary source so we break down their two segments in the following way.\n\n\nValue to 1% : Consumers, Large shareholders (e.g. investors, founders, etc.), Owners with multiple properties supplementing income\n\n\n_ Social Good_ : Renters who use Airbnb as a sublet to survive and owners who rent out property to support affording their homes.\n\n\n\nComparing Doing Good and Doing Well (2020)\nHere we‚Äôll make a number of simplifying assumptions since we don‚Äôt have all of the numbers, but we can quantify _Doing Well _and Doing Good by thinking about the segments we used above.\nDoorDash\nDoing Well : **1.96B rev @[49.15B mkt cap ](www.google.com/finance/quote/DASH:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx6ue36IzuAhXAFFkFHWyjCLoQ3ecFMAB6BAgBEBk) **\n\n_Reasoning: this is purely a measure of how well the company makes money and the value the market attributes to it which benefits shareholders. Since DoorDash is a product of convenience, the very product benefits consumers willing to pay extra for that convenience. _\n\nDoing Good : 3.12B earnings for ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù + 8.46B Merchant sales\n\n_ Reasoning : ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù earn on average [~15 / hour, ~1 / mile, &amp; ~8 / trip](gridwise.io/how-much-are-doordash-drivers-making-in-2020). For ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù if we assume they are about 80% of the [median of hours worked for gig workers, we can use ~20 hrs / week](www.statista.com/statistics/916508/gig-economy-total-number-hours-worked-per-week/), which comes out to **** 300 / week **** or 15,600 / year **** earned by a single ‚ÄúDasher‚Äù. While we assume a normal distribution, this is certainly not the case, so assuming ~20% of 1M ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù encapsulate the bulk of distribution, we find **3.12B of earnings for ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù.** While an estimate, it is reasonable given 7B of earnings reported for ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù since it‚Äôs founding](www.meritechcapital.com/blog/doordash-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=DashPass%20costs%20%249.99%20per%20month,digital%20experience%20and%20strong%20value.) and much of that coming in the last 2 years. For Merchants, [19B of merchant sales have been reported since founding, and with a similar distribution as for ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù we can expect ~ $8.46B in merchant sales in 2020. _\n\nAirbnb\nDoing Well : **2.52B rev @[90.82B mkt cap](www.google.com/finance/quote/ABNB:NASDAQ) **\n\n_Reasoning : this is a measure of the company‚Äôs ability to make money which is directly correlated to the value gained by homeowners and the attributed market value which benefits shareholders. Customers with disposable income for travel and familiarity with technology benefit from the convenience of Airbnb‚Äôs service. _\n\nDoing Good : $3.93B earnings for hosts using this as a means to keep their house or as a sublet\n\n_ Reasoning : We calculated this by using these numbers from their S-1 where 72% of hosts in NYC fit the group described. Assuming NYC is the 98th percentile of a normal distribution ~37% of hosts might fit this bill. With a host fee ~ 3% and a 20% markup for renters from Airbnb we have $10.63B **** in total host earnings of which 37% fit the bill. _\n\nWhat does this all mean?\nThis doesn‚Äôt completely tell the whole story because we aren‚Äôt looking at gross income. For those vulnerable populations this is not supplemental or disposable income, but the bare minimum to survive. With DoorDash , for example, there are legitimate arguments to be made about value not truly helping ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù , but even hurting them because the 15,600 / yr average earnings causes them to actually lose money over time with the cost of driving. Similarly for **Airbnb** , it has been shown [that housing costs increase in areas where Airbnb has been introduced](www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/), ultimately hurting the same populations they hope to benefit with the nearly 4B in aggregate earnings.\n\n_So if we simply took the numbers for Social Good vs. Value to 1% , we could argue DoorDash‚Äôs Good / Value ratio is ~ 20% (11B/50B) and Airbnb‚Äôs is ~ 4.4% (4B/91B), but that‚Äôs likely an overestimate given the negatives _\n\n\nConclusion\nThere‚Äôs no doubt, that like many other tech companies out there, DoorDash and Airbnb are making a LOT of money for investors\n\nBut they also generate positive outcomes for those vulnerable populations. Other examples exist such as ad-powered platforms like Google and Facebook which enable small business owners, influencers and many others to benefit from ad revenue.\n\nDoorDash and Airbnb may not be one of the Doing Well by Doing Good companies as we‚Äôve defined them, but both DoorDash and Airbnb have made a LARGE positive impact and have both DONE WELL ‚Äî to the tune of $10s of Billions ‚Äî and DONE GOOD ‚Äî on the order of Billions. To put it simply:\n\nDoorDash does more good than Airbnb , but there‚Äôs also likely some bad that comes out of both of their business models. Companies like DoorDash and Airbnb however, want to do better and have an honest spirit, which can‚Äôt be said of every company out there. Not every business can Do Well by Doing Good, BUT every company can do some good, and DoorDash and Airbnb are great examples of how to do that even when the product or service you provide may not directly do that.\n\nHope you found this informative!

But this got me thinking, mission and Doing Well by Doing Good aside, how much social good does Robinhood actually do?\nDisclaimer: I am by no means an expert and this analysis will be cursory since it still is a private company and we don‚Äôt have all the numbers\nTypically we would wait for the S-1 to analyze Robinhood, but given their position as a brokerage we found a lot of numbers online about their dealings.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll explore how Robinhood, still pre-IPO, makes it‚Äôs money and calculate the a TENTATIVE measure of the social good it creates through it‚Äôs stock trading platform. First, a TLDR; for those who want the answer ‚Äî then the basics üòÄ\n\nTLDR;\nRobinhood‚Äôs Tentative Social Good Ratio : 78M / 10.2B ~ 0.76%\n\nWhat is Robinhood üì±?\n**Robinhood **is a company and app founded by two former physics PhDs, Bhaiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev, two previous quants, who realized they wanted to make the financial markets accessible to anyone even with just a few dollars to spend.\nRobinhood‚Äôs mission, much like the folk hero himself, is\n\n_ To democratize finance for all. We believe that everyone should have access to the financial markets, so we‚Äôve built Robinhood from the ground up to make investing friendly, approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike._\n\nHow Do They Make Money?\nAccording to this Forbes Report, the largest component of Robinhood‚Äôs Q1 2020 revenue is ‚Äúpayment for order flow,‚Äù or PFOF. In the tech world, we might call this ‚Äúselling the data‚Äù, which in the finance world is fairly common, as co-founder Baiju Bhatt notes, but they also have more traditional SaaS revenues on premium products.\n\n\n\nPremium Membership Subscriptions: SaaS revenue from value-added services like Robinhood Gold\n\n\nS ecurities Lending: Lending customer securities to customers (e.g. hedge funds) for cash collateral [Job Description]\n\n\nPayment for Order Flow : Selling order data to Algorithmic Quant Traders\n\n\nThis breakdown is fundamentally different from traditional brokerages like E-trade where PFOF is a minority of the revenue &lt; 20%. This then begs the question, how does this help the user?\nHonestly we may not need to know these numbers since most don‚Äôt affect the users directly other than the premium membership services, but they help frame the business model.\nShow Me the Numbers\nData outlining the potential returns of an app like Robinhood in fairly sparse, but to start there is a lot of good information on the money made and transacted on the Robinhood app. According to App Statistics  on Robinhood, some key metrics about users, and amount managed are pretty staggering.\n\n\n13M Users in 2020\n\n\n$180M Q2 2020 Revenues\n\n\n$150B of transacted trades\n\n\n1000 - 5000 range of user accounts, median: $2000\n\n\n**20B** under assets (compare to 600B under assets from E-trade)\n\n\n$10.2B valuation\n\n\nMost interesting however data from Robintrack as of Dec 2020 (website since shut down), which shares a bit more about the popularity of trades and some inkling of the types of returns and losses experienced by users.\n\n\nRobinhood users are 10% more likely to buy and sell top 10 stocks than users on other brokerage sites\n\n\n11% - 42% returns followed by - 5% to - 9% losses the month after on ‚ÄúHerding Events‚Äù defined as 0.5% of events where there is a user increase of more than 1,000 and more than 50 percent relative to the previous day\n\n\n63% of the time returns are positive (average of 3.5% to 6.4% in extreme scenarios) if every user uses a strategy of selling after a Robinhood ‚ÄúHerding Event‚Äù and repurchasing five days later.\n\n\nHow Much üíµ Does Robinhood Generate for Their Most Vulnerable Users?\nLet‚Äôs first look at the users ‚Äî how do we characterize ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù. We know the range is 1000 to 5000 average holdings on the platform with a media of 2000. While this may not capture the full spread, we consider the area under the curve below 2000 to be the user base we care about. Given it‚Äôs a skewed distribution, we estimate this at ~20% of 13M or ~2.6M users.\n_NOTE : True demographic data is needed to truly identify the right user segment since the average account amount is a poor indicator of socio-economics since it is conflated with trust in Robinhood, and perhaps even negatively correlated to those with wealth who may be trading on more traditional brokerage platforms. _\nOf these 2.6M users, we assume that the vast majority are unsophisticated, which argues that the majority, let‚Äôs say 70% of whom will play a ‚Äúmedium strategy‚Äù akin to that suggested above by Robintrack with 63% success or worse. We assume we take out outliers from both tails (more from the high end than the low end because ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù is not as likely), then the average return of 3.4% reduces by a bit to say 2.5%.\n\nSince we only selected users with accounts &lt; 2000, the average account value is around 1200, which on an annual return of 2.5%, nets:\n\n1200 x 2.5% = 30 / user / year\n\nTentative Social Good Ratio\nOverall, this amounts to $78M in value generated for these users. Of course, this is pure financial return. There is much to say about the enjoyment of day trading and the fun that someone may gain, but the assumption is these users are focused on the monetary outcome rather than the auxiliary benefits.\nMuch like public companies with a direct Market Cap, we compare this to the latest valuation of Robinhood @ $10.2B to come up with the Tentative Social Good Ratio\n\n_ Tentative_ Social Good Ratio: 78M / 10.2B ~ 0.76%\n\nWithout a full S-1, much like the very traders on Robinhood, much of this calculation is speculation **** and more data is needed to confirm or deny this. It‚Äôs very possible Robinhood is helping unsophisticated traders execute better strategies as their data moat becomes bigger, and the numbers are and will be much better than we can see today‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll come back to that once we have that.\n\nConclusion\nRobinhood, isn‚Äôt Doing Well by Doing Good in the sense of our blog here, since the users and the fundamental purpose of the app targets people with some extra cash to burn, but Day Trading is risky business and it‚Äôs hard to say enabling it for less sophisticated users is all good. But they are doing _some good. _Posts like this one are more about highlighting the ‚ÄúSocial Good‚Äù any company can do even if their product or service doesn‚Äôt directly deliver that.\nWhen it comes to doing good companies, just take it from Pete:\n\nSo in case you were asking yourself: _ ‚ÄúShould I keep trading with Robinhood?‚Äù_. If you think they‚Äôre evil, they certainly aren‚Äôt completely. They are making a positive impact, even if some of their practices are can seem predatory because of how they mirror traditional banks. The reality is, every company needs to make money, the only question is, how much of that money can contribute toward helping those that need it most rather than just the **** 1%. The debate still continues‚Ä¶ And hopefully with Robinhood‚Äôs S-1 coming out soon, we‚Äôll be able to revisit this very soon.\n\nMaybe we should start to question the motives of some companies themselves, but just remember that if we look for it, we can find good in many unexpected places.\n\nStay positive, stay sane, and stay healthy!\n‚úåüèΩAnand\n"},"20210210-perlara-ceo-ethan-perlstein-on-new-models-for-biopharma":{"title":"üéôÔ∏è¬† Perlara CEO Ethan Perlstein on New Models for Biopharma","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"original link: thegoodaipod.substack.com/p/-podcast-ep-6-perlara-ceo-ethan-perlstein\nüéôÔ∏è¬† Perlara CEO Ethan Perlstein on New Models for Biopharma\nFebruary 10, 2021\nüëãüèΩ Welcome to Doing Well by Doing Good, a newsletter and podcast series highlighting the companies aiming to be profitable with a purpose.\n\nHappy Wednesday folks! I am super excited to share the latest in our Podcasts, with a very unique company Perlara. Ethan Perlstein, the CEO of Public Benefit Corporation Perlara, wears many hats, from scientist, to cure-sherpa, to non-profit owner. His career revolves around helping patients with rare diseases, and in this episode, we explore how Perlara is bringing a Doing Well by Doing Good model to the BioPharma space.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or click below for the Anchor FM Podcast. Or scroll down to read through the transcript and click right to the section of interest.\n\nBackground\nAnand 0:56 What was your founding journey at Perlara? How did you get to where you are today?\n**Ethan 1:01 **So Perlara started initially as Perlstein lab actually, because I couldn‚Äôt think of a better name on my own. It started in early 2014. And I started this as the first time CEO and entrepreneur coming out of my postdoctoral training. And before that, had come straight out of graduate school before that straight out of college. So I had been on the academic path. And then, through a set of circumstances, including not getting an academic job, in any of the places I applied, decided to check out some other possibilities and startups at this time were getting more and more into the popular culture seeping into the popular culture through Shark Tank. And in other ways then the startup JOBS Act was passed in 2012. And that kind of opened up this new crowdfunding space, and Kickstarter was just making waves. So there was all this enthusiasm about startups. So I got caught up in that and decided that I, instead of trying to get an academic position as an assistant professor somewhere, I would just start a company. And that‚Äôs kind of how Perlara was practically, you know, came into existence. And sort of from there, there‚Äôs been a roller coaster ride. But right now, Perlara is, I guess, in a kind of reboot to transition state from 1.0 to 2.0. And can get into that story and I have in other other forums, but really excited to think about the future in a couple years from now, when I think that the company can reconstitute. But right now, it‚Äôs a virtual clinical development company. Basically, just me unpaid as the only employee, sort of pushing it, pushing the once embers of a project now into the clinic.\nAnand 2:50 That‚Äôs pretty awesome. So I mean, well, you know, you obviously have a very interesting history here. So what are some of the challenges that you faced along the way, obviously, in particular, as a biopharma public benefit corporation?\nEthan 3:05 Well, in the beginning, when I was going out talking about Perlara as a PPC, and I had heard about other PBCs, and thought, this is really a cool experiment that should be running biotech, because it‚Äôs been running in other industries. And this idea of, you know, Doing Well by Doing Good is not a new concept. I mean, PBCs have become maybe associated with like, airports and other utilities in the economy. But this concept of Doing Well by Doing Good, I think, is one that has been kind of resuscitated in the form of a PBC. And that movement kind of started in 2010. And so I thought it‚Äôd be a cool idea to run a PBC experiment in biotech. And I think the initial challenges were, no one knew what that was. And it didn‚Äôt necessarily scare investors or, or others, but people just didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. But for me, it was a great recruiting tool, and it helped define the company culture, help differentiate Perlara from other startups in the biopharma space. And it kind of it addressed a glaring need because there was a lot of complaining about especially today about drug pricing, and how pharma kind of doesn‚Äôt get the reputation it deserves. And so I wanted to go to the root of that problem, this kind of public perception problem, and also get to the root of a lot of the inequities and inequalities we see in healthcare. And that‚Äôs kind of where the PBC concept came about. But again, it was very new then. It‚Äôs gotten validated today, but I think the biggest obstacle was just getting people to understand that this is an experiment worth running in biotech and that there should be more biotech PBCs.\nMission &amp; Culture\nAnand 4:52 Yeah, and definitely we‚Äôll get to that part later on in the podcast. The next question I have is what was Perlara‚Äôs or what is Perlara‚Äôs company mission, right as you‚Äôre going through this reboot, and how does being a PBC play into that? And has that changed in your history? Or has that been the same since the beginning?\nEthan 5:11 I think there‚Äôs been a consistent thread line going back, you know, to the earliest days, where it‚Äôs a pretty simple sort of value proposition and a pretty simple mission. You know, the value proposition is if you work with highly motivated families and foundations in rare diseases, they‚Äôre the most amazing business partners I think you could ever find.\nAnand 5:32 Because they are really motivated by the problem, right?\nEthan 5:36 Absolutely. They‚Äôre really motivated by problem. They, they act like a startup on steroids, right, using urgency, you know, they‚Äôre struggling to find product market fit, there‚Äôs only limited runway, you know, constraint breeds creativity, and so forth. So they‚Äôre just natural partners in drug development, which is a very fraught and, you know, failure prone process. So that‚Äôs the value proposition. And I think that that‚Äôs worth a lot. And then if you take that value proposition to its extreme, it says, well then you want to form companies with these people, you don‚Äôt just want to take their data or use them to fundraise for you, you actually want to go to the logic stream and make them your business partners, and you want to be 50/50 partners. And so I think that‚Äôs kind of to me how we‚Äôre embodying that the PBC or at least how, how we‚Äôre taking how we‚Äôre using that to differentiate and to encode in the company‚Äôs DNA that this is the business activity we‚Äôre doing. And we want investors who are aligned with that. And then the challenge comes when you go to the public markets, how do you kind of maintain that, that mission? So we haven‚Äôt gotten to that point, the experiment, but yeah, I think there‚Äôs been a very consistent vision, at least, you know, I believe, where I thought, geez, when you work with these highly motivated families, and foundations, you can just kind of move mountains, and they‚Äôre just things, just things happen. And then and then if you view that as not just a one off kind of thing, then turn it into a business and industrialize it, then that‚Äôs, to me the big opportunity.\nAnand 7:14 Cool. And so if you had to give the mission in one sentence, what would it be?\nEthan 7:18 Partnering with highly motivated families to cure rare genetic diseases.\nDoing Well\nAnand 7:23 Yeah, that‚Äôs a powerful one. So I thought we could move on to another part, which is, so this talk is about doing well, by doing good. And you mentioned it a couple times. So the first part is doing well. How do you know, biopharma companies and typically have have done quite well. So the question I have is, you know, how at Perlara are you thinking about becoming profitable? You know, what are the levers that you can pull? And how does again, PBC play into that?\nEthan 7:51 Yeah, I mean, I think there‚Äôs multiple ways to get profitable and working with families, developing disease models, doing repurposing screens, you know, that business cannot break profitably. It‚Äôs challenging to do so if you‚Äôre based in the Bay Area. But if you are not, and we‚Äôre in a less expensive market, that business is already kind of profitable on its own. It‚Äôs not a venture scale business. And then, of course, you could even abstract that another level and say, Well, you can also provide sort of cure sherpa consulting services to families, where you don‚Äôt even have to do the research in a lab for them, you just actually organize the research plan and help them execute it. That‚Äôs a profitable business, especially in the age of COVID, where you can do that, you know, or you can do that through conversations like this. And then when the real challenge is the profitability on the drug product side, which is, you know, what Bio Pharma is really supposed to do. And there I think with repurposing, the way to get that to be profitable is, you know, identifying opportunities that exist off the shelf to take medicine, old medicines and give them new life, to the margins, there are killer because someone else already paid for all the safety, all the other kind of expensive clinical trial pieces, especially if it‚Äôs for a drug that was for a large indication. So yeah, I think where the PBC part comes in, is to sort of think about well, how would you price things? And what value are you offering to patient communities? You know, are you just sort of offering the same static product and hope to extract you know, rent from it over the course of its patent life? And if you can command orphan pricing, do you do so? Or do you take more of a tech model of delivering value where it‚Äôs not just about a product that works? In this case, a drug that helps, but also a product experience? You know, what if you could reimagine what would it would if you could imagine the consumer experience you get from an Apple product you got from a drug, or there was an app and there was thought to delivery and there was thought to design and to, you know, to dosage forms and‚Ä¶\nAnand 10:07 Recurring revenue which can be valuable, right much more valuable for a company, as opposed to you know, a one time fee.\nEthan 10:12 That‚Äôs right. But also the idea that you‚Äôre going to every year release an improved version, right, and you‚Äôre going to continually iteratively improve this, it‚Äôs not just a static product where you‚Äôre trying to squeeze out the value, maximize value over a patent life, and then it falls off a cliff, and you‚Äôre done with it. It‚Äôs like, how do you turn this into a long term sustained relationship? And that‚Äôs where PBC I think, is initially a marketing and branding advantage, or it can kind of, you know, it can talk to talk because it actually walks the walk. But then yeah, the more creative challenges ahead, when like, a PBC actually does go into the public markets, and then how does it I was able to sort of keep its mission, honor its mission, while having access to a global capital pool, where maybe not everybody is interested in what you‚Äôre interested in, in terms of, you know, maximizing patient experience, they might be interested in maximizing profits. So yeah, I think there‚Äôs multiple ways to get the profitable, and then the ways that really matter, are the ones where you‚Äôre actually delivering to patients. And what can you do to not just command orphan pricing, because you can.\nAnand 11:17 Yeah, so like, the key difference between Perlara and a standard biopharma company would be, you know, the profitability angle is sort of covered in many different formats, it seems like you could do it through the consulting and beginning of the process, or later on, when you‚Äôre like actually selling the drug make margins on that. But it seems like the key difference is one what you focus on, which is you know, focus on patient care, focus on making sure they get what they need, versus like, just trying to make money off of the drug, like just profitability. And then it seems like the second thing might be sort of the way that you combine or maybe match, you know, shareholder value with the social good mission of helping the patient.\nEthan 12:01 Exactly, exactly. And I think ultimately, that means, basically, just kind of, like what Airbnb is doing, and other companies are thinking about is, how do you turn your users or your customers, into owners, to fractional co-owners? And again, biotechs are not the place where these ideas are originating. But you know, not a lot of people are doing these experiments yet, because there isn‚Äôt discipline as there are in other verticals.\nAnand 12:29 Basically, you‚Äôre saying that the patient have like a part of the profit as well, or like the patient.\nEthan 12:34 Potentially, why not think about profit sharing in that way? And why not think about, again, more cooperative types of structures, or just place or opportunities for customers, or users as you use a tech example to be co-owners and to have, you know, like, what if the average Twitter user could not just be monetizing, you know, your content? But actually, what if you can actually capture the upside of the platform business?\nAnand 12:56 Yeah, like, basically, because your data has been used. Right. So then how do you capture some of the upside.\nEthan 13:01 Exactly, exactly.\nAnand 13:04 That‚Äôs very interesting. Okay. Yeah, so that‚Äôs pretty clear. So then, you know, there‚Äôs many ways to do well, there‚Äôs many ways to make profits. But this is very different from a normal biopharma company because of the PBC structure also, because you‚Äôre kind of focused on the venture scale, the, you know, you‚Äôre using concepts from Tech in order to try to apply them now to biopharma. So that you can have more recurring and more sort of tech margins, because I think your point, if I understand correctly, and you know, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, is that if you focus on adding additional value throughout the cycle, right, as opposed to just like getting the value one time through the drug, then what you‚Äôre doing is helping the patient because the patient really cares about the entire process, right, that entire care process of getting cured.\nEthan 13:50 Exactly, exactly. Yeah, exactly.\nDoing Good\nAnand 13:54 Makes a lot of sense. So actually, that‚Äôs actually a pretty good segue into the next part, which is Doing Good. You know, this is a question I asked everyone, which is, with Perlara, you know, it‚Äôs gonna be a huge success in 10 years. Right. So what global challenge will you have helped solve?\nEthan 14:11 Well, I mean, the problem I think will be solved, maybe in geographical chunks first, but I think to your point, we can‚Äôt just provide access to cures or treatments to rare diseases for families that are living in the United States alone, or in the richest countries, we have to ensure that these kinds of treatments are affordable, and even still profitable anywhere in the globe. So I think that‚Äôs sort of, you kind of nailed it on the head in terms of, I think, actually achieving global follow through is really the challenge here.\nAnand 14:50 Yeah, totally. And so you know, you touched upon this a little bit about why you created a PBC but let‚Äôs say that you had an option at the beginning, maybe and maybe you had this option anyways, which was why build a for profit PBC versus a for-profit generally C-Corp or a nonprofit.\nEthan 15:11 I mean, you could have done it as a just a vanilla C-Corp and just sort of say, I‚Äôm just gonna be different, right? And maybe these companies will put out pledges about, you know, we promise not to do X, Y, and Z. But the thing with pledges is that pledges can be broken, and, you know, management teams can change. And so I think, yeah, it could have been done as a C-Corp. But again, that‚Äôs about running an experiment here from start to finish, in terms of starting as a private company, eventually going into the public markets and maintaining that, as you said, find that match between shareholder value and honoring the social mission. So you might have thought, well, maybe you could do that as a nonprofit. But then yeah, I mean, you know, I work as a CEO now is a nonprofit that‚Äôs focused on N-of-ones. And, you know, nonprofits are good for certain kinds of activities. And they‚Äôre not necessarily optimized for other types of activities where a for-profit might be. So that‚Äôs why I feel like the PBC gives you this ability to kind of have a hybrid or partake of kind of the best of both structures, potentially. Because, you know, you could argue that one, one form or the other, if it‚Äôs sort of done to kind of maximize profit, let‚Äôs say, or for nonprofit to maximize good, you know, there‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôre not going to miss your mark, if you just sort of too faithfully and dogmatically pursue that and so a PBC that can kind of take on shades of both, maybe ends up in a more agile position.\nAnand 16:33 And I suppose you know, you‚Äôre in a unique position, running a nonprofit, as well as a for profit, PBC, which is interesting, because then you‚Äôd have the concept that really, choosing one of these just means, how you want to go about it. And it‚Äôs really just a matter of, you know, what is the what is the method you want to take? And is one of the reasons growth in Do you believe that growth, venture-scale, for example, can be easier achieved if it‚Äôs a for-profit versus a nonprofit?\nEthan 17:03 Yeah, absolutely. So I think that‚Äôs the point is, if you set it up as a nonprofit, then you can avail yourself of venture capital, if you can offer that kind of growth. And I think, if you‚Äôre able to sort of show that a few rare disease drugs can be, you know, expanded into a blockbuster market. That‚Äôs the growth that‚Äôs venture backed right now with growth potential for biotech platforms. So you‚Äôd be kind of silly, you‚Äôd be shooting yourself in the foot, if you really had a big aspiration, but you cut yourself off of certain funding mechanisms, you know, because it‚Äôs the opportunity to dovetail shareholder value, or in this case, VC value with with the mission, because if you get it right, it‚Äôs a win-win.\nAnand 17:44 Yeah. And everybody wins. And I think that‚Äôs interesting, because that‚Äôs one of the common themes that we‚Äôve been hearing, which is that build a for-profit, because when you build that for-profit, you can actually prove out some of that shareholder value. And then when you can prove that out or even if initially, you kind of have a plan to do it, and then eventually you‚Äôll do it, VCs, right, early early stage or later stage, whatever they‚Äôll want to invest because they want to see that growth. Yep. Okay, that‚Äôs actually very cool to see. And it‚Äôs really interesting to see that that‚Äôs also the case in biopharma. Right.\nBig Pharma Trends\nAnand 18:16 And, you know, I‚Äôm curious, this is more personal curiosity, but you know, how many biopharma startups are that mean, I‚Äôve seen a lot recently. And so, you know, I‚Äôm curious, is it sort of commonplace to think that in biopharma specifically for-profit, high-growth, a lot of VCs want to invest in it. Or do you feel that, you know, maybe it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs still a growing field from the startup side, at least, like the big players really dominate?\nEthan 18:40 I‚Äôm not sure I quite got the question. Sorry.\nAnand 18:44 This is again, this is like my own personal question. I just came out of nowhere, but. So basically, do you feel that large companies dominate the market? Or do you feel that startups actually have an advantage in the biopharma market? Because you know, they can attract venture capital, they can do new things, and they can really disrupt the complete space.\nEthan 19:04 Yeah, I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt frame it where they‚Äôre sort of either-or right. I mean, because the way the biotech ecosystem works, unlike tech, and a lot of ways is that, you know, you‚Äôve got the big pharma, but what do you think are the LPs and all the biotech VCs? Right? The big pharma companies, right? And so, you know, that money is being used to create companies, which then guess what get acquired by those same pharma/LPs, right? So it‚Äôs like, in biotech, it‚Äôs sort of like this cycle where there, it‚Äôs this capital ecosystem, where there‚Äôs a cyclical flow, right, from the incumbents to creating new companies, which then eventually, you know, get absorbed by the incumbents, and the VCs are basically just making money on kind of on both sides. So a marketplace but yeah, you know once upon a time bio, biopharma companies were fully integrated, and they did everything right. And as they all started to get outsourced in the 90s. And even late 80s. But now you have the state where big pharma companies are basically just these kind of holding companies that are really good at running clinical trials at scale. But they‚Äôre sourcing all their R&amp;D, from the earliest stages to like Phase 2b assets and everything in between. And there are some companies like Novartis that are old-school that can still that are truly fully integrated and global, but they‚Äôre still sourcing a lot of their discovery from from outside it because they realize, like anybody else that the greatest discoveries aren‚Äôt always generated in-house.\nAnand 20:37 Yeah that totally makes sense. Yeah. And this was a personal question, because, you know, I don‚Äôt understand biopharma as well. So it‚Äôs actually really helpful to get that background. And I think it‚Äôs probably true in other sectors as well, but probably not as not as much true, as in biopharma where it really there‚Äôs like a lot of big players that play in all fields, right, including VC funds. Cool. All right. Well, I think that‚Äôs pretty clear on how Perlara and PBCs, do good.\nAdvice for DWDG Listeners\n**Anand 21:05 **I thought the last thing I wanted to touch on was really advice. So do you have any advice for either founders that are trying to start a company that‚Äôs Doing Well by Doing Good, either in biopharma or otherwise? And/or professionals that want to do something positive or want to work for a company like Perlara?\nEthan 21:23 Yeah, I mean, the best advice is, if someone‚Äôs got a really great scientific idea, and they realize they don‚Äôt want to just kind of mouth talking points about patients first, and patients health first and if they actually want to help change this healthcare system, writ large, even within Pharma, like they really want to affect change, then yeah, maybe they can kind of consider these other other corporate structures, maybe they can consider a company mission and a company culture that is going to attract people away from maybe startups that don‚Äôt have that same vision. So, yeah, my advice would be if some, if a founder or founding team sees an opportunity to be a PBC, and it will help make their business stronger than they shouldn‚Äôt hesitate, you know, they should do it. And if anyone wants to sort of, you know, have a discussion or debate about PBCs, I‚Äôm more than welcome to do that. You can find me on Twitter anytime. But yeah, I mean, other voices are having, you know, this similar conversation. So, you know, the best advice is, obviously, to really do your homework and to listen to all perspectives. So if there are people who, you know, are thinking about ways to reform the health care system that are not highlighting PBCs but are highlighting something else and listen to them to just soak up as much information as possible.\nAnand 22:49 Well, that‚Äôs great advice. Thanks again for taking the time. I really appreciate it.\nEthan 22:54 No worries.

We are excited to share our latest podcast interview with Leaf Global CEO and Africa Microfinance expertNat Robinson!\n\nIn previous episodes, we‚Äôve talked about FinTech products that help the disadvantaged transfer financial access cross borders with Misha Esipov at Nova Credit enabling credit access to US Immigrants. In this episode we explore how Leaf Global is different by targeting _the unbanked refugees_ , or those without access to banks (or smartphones) at all, and provide them a blockchain-powered wallet and accessible on non-smartphones. Nat shares his experience building businesses in Africa, the Leaf Global journey including their initial services in Rwanda and the border of the Congo, and what Doing Well by Doing Good means for them.\nClick below to listen to the episode or check out the key takeaways and transcripts below the fold and click on the time to go directly to your favorite part!\n Listen to the Episode\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n_ What is Leaf Global?:_ Leaf is a blockchain based digital wallet that provides financial services to the stateless and excluded on a mobile device. There‚Äôs no smartphone required\n\n\n_ How did Leaf get Started?_ : Nat grew a microfinance company Juhudi Kilimo in Kenya for a number of years, went to law school, and got inspired to solve the refugee crisis in the best way he knew how.\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs Unique about Leaf‚Äôs Approach? Leaf takes a high growth VC-backed approach to solving tough challenges in Africa\n\n\n_ Mission and Culture:_ Provide economic security to the stateless and excluded, starting with refugees and migrants. Leaf is building a mission-driven, open-minded, tech-minded culture.\n\n\nChallenges: As a company focused on transactions and customers without smartphones (or internet at all), COVID has been tough, but also an opportunity for out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n\nDoing Well : Leaf makes money through transfer fees, foreign exchange spread, expanding to selling airtime to customers, and eventually providing lending products (as Nat did at Juhudi Kilimo)\n\n\nBalancing Shareholder Value and Mission? : Leaf focuses on finding metrics that connect impact and business value to help stakeholders align on the mission.\n\n\n_ Doing Good_ : Leaf addresses the nearly 2.4 Billion unbanked individuals without smartphones and specifically addresses the refugees vulnerable to lack of funds when they travel across borders.\n\n\nAdvice for Listeners: If you‚Äôre interested in social impact, just go out there and do it. Don‚Äôt wait for an opportunity to start a business‚Äîvolunteer, connect with people, reach out, and get started today ‚Äî this market knowledge will serve you well.\n\n\n\nWhat is Leaf Global?\nAnand 0:03 Welcome to the Doing Well by Doing Good podcast where we highlight the startups that are aiming to be profitable with a purpose. I‚Äôm your host Anand and today we‚Äôre talking to Nat Robinson, founder and CEO of Colorado based FinTech, startup Leaf Global. Leaf Global is a for profit social enterprise focused on providing financial services to the unbanked. In this episode, we‚Äôll talk about his experiences starting companies in Africa, and how Doing Well by Doing Good can take multiple forms. Welcome, Nat, to the show!\nNat 0:34 Thank you. Thanks so much for including me really looking forward to participating.\nAnand 0:39 Well, why don‚Äôt we jump right in? How would you describe Leaf Global in one line?\nNat 0:44 So in one line, Leaf is a blockchain based digital wallet that provides financial services to the stateless and excluded on a mobile device. There‚Äôs no smartphone required. Is that close to a sentence?\nAnand 1:01 I think that was that was perfect.\nNat 1:03 Long sentence. Okay.\nHow Did Leaf Global Get Started?\nAnand 1:05 Actually not that long. Pretty, pretty good. Okay, there‚Äôs a lot of stuff packed in there. And we‚Äôll get to, I‚Äôm sure, each one of those. I was thinking maybe what we could start with is a quick background. How did you get to where you are today? How did you get to starting Leaf Global, and particularly looking at the Africa market?\nNat 1:28 Sure. Absolutely. And we‚Äôve structured Leaf to be a global company, but have focused on East Africa to start, I think, primarily, because I saw this challenge that refugees and migrants were facing worldwide when fleeing conflict, and having to carry cash across borders, which is dangerous and inconvenient. And then can be expensive to exchange currencies, and in many cases, refugees, migrants struggle to create accounts. So there is a big an unmet need. And then there‚Äôs this growing development of technical solutions and FinTech that are all providing more access to people all over the world. So if you have a mobile phone, you can access bank accounts. And that was something I became very familiar with in Kenya. I started and ran a microfinance company called Juhudi Kilimo, in Kenya that was providing loans to rural smallholder farmers. And we integrated a lot of technology we used Mpesa, may be familiar with kind of like Venmo for a dumb phone. But it‚Äôs been happening in very ubiquitous across East Africa for the last 10 years, and particularly in Kenya and really found a way to leverage technology to deliver a financial service to a customer base that doesn‚Äôt have access to that and do it in a way that‚Äôs not only profitable, but also helpful to our end customers. So this is the next generation of that is looking across borders and globally at refugees and migrants to support them.\nAnand 2:53 So you basically started with farmers in Kenya, and then you‚Äôre now expanding this from a more technically scalable perspective, to then make it available to migrants and refugees across the world.\nNat 3:07 Yeah, and I wish it was that simple and logical step. Yeah, I actually left Juhudi after seven years and was ready for a transition. The company is still going; this is the agriculture microfinance company in Kenya, I came to the US to get a law degree and thought that would be good way to transition back to America was kind of anticipating going into law or working with a fund but while I was at law school got involved in a business plan competition called the Hult Prize, which at the time was sponsored by the Clinton Foundation. And every year, this group puts together a challenge that addresses some global social issues. So if it‚Äôs environmental challenge, if it‚Äôs global hunger, and the year that I was there, it was looking at the global refugee crisis, which I didn‚Äôt know much about and coming up with business ideas to address the global refugee crisis. And so while a student at Vanderbilt got paired up with a team of other grad students, and we came up with a number of different ideas and ended up pitching a very different one. But did well we made it to the finals in Dubai, and we were just about to win a million dollars. And from that experience, that while this is maybe there‚Äôs something here, there‚Äôs a big opportunity, I can leverage my experience in financial services in Africa and see if there‚Äôs more that I can do to address the challenge. And I think also got some of that experience pitching and explaining a complex business idea to a group of judges and investors and then sort of slowly snowballed the concepts from there continue to do more pitch competitions and raised money and recruited more students at Vanderbilt and was able to test an initial product and some technology on the border of Congo and Rwanda before graduating and then went full time in 2018 with Leaf.\nLeaf Global and Juhudi Kilimo ‚Äî Difference in Approach\nAnand 4:55 Wow, that‚Äôs action packed. So I have a question because you talk in your book about your work at Juhudi Kilimo. And there you talked a lot about working with investors, it seems like you had a lot of experience already in that regard, of course, you know, perhaps slightly different than the investors, you‚Äôre attracting for Leaf Global. So I‚Äôm curious, did you see any differences there?\nNat 5:20 Yeah. I wrote that book to help anyone who‚Äôs wanted to get into social enterprise to avoid all the mistakes that I made the first time, because I made a lot of them and want to be open with that. And so you‚Äôd think that coming into starting another company, that I‚Äôd be better at this, but it‚Äôs still really hard and particularly hard starting from scratch, I think that‚Äôs what I thought was pretty gonna be exciting with Leaf is starting from the idea, whereas with Juhudi Kilimo, there‚Äôs already a concept, there‚Äôs a bank that was piloting this loan idea for rural smallholder farmers and I helped spin that off and create a company with it. So really wanted that full lifecycle of the startup. But quickly found out that raising capital zero to a million dollars is really hard, especially when you‚Äôre in that idea phase or prototype phase. And then layer on top of that, using a new technology using blockchain that is less understood and not as well tested, and then working with a customer base that no one‚Äôs really served before, the refugees and migrants. So it‚Äôs been an uphill battle convincing investors that this is not only a profitable, sustainable business, but it‚Äôs something that can also help people globally. So we‚Äôre in this weird space of talking to traditional VCs in Silicon Valley investors, who love the technology, love our use of the technology, but are really terrified of Africa in many cases, or just see it as a big risk. Whereas a lot of the impact investors who I worked with at Juhudi Kilimo, and within that community, very comfortable with Africa and the market, but shy away from the new technology and really don‚Äôt want anything to do with blockchain technology. So it‚Äôs been a lot harder than I thought to get this going.\nChallenges Building Leaf\nAnand 7:04 Yeah, you don‚Äôt shy away from the challenge. There‚Äôs always a new challenge. Well, so that kind of takes me to my next question about challenges. You mentioned a few challenges with investors. So I‚Äôm curious with Leaf Global, what other challenges have you faced along the way, perhaps on the customer side or on growing the market?\nNat 7:24 Yeah. And I think anyone who‚Äôs coming at entrepreneurship, or social entrepreneurship, as a lawyer, which I was fresh out of law school, I looked at the world very differently, much more conservative, I feel like we spent a ton of time on regulation and on compliance. Because we‚Äôre moving money across borders, we‚Äôre working with a less documented population. So you can imagine there‚Äôs all kinds of sticky legal issues that we have to worry about. So that took a lot of our time, trying to find a strategy through all that and find good partners who are comfortable working with us to to do the work that we‚Äôre now doing. We‚Äôre finally over that hurdle as we launched a live product in September last year, of course, during COVID is also a wonderful time to start a business. No money is out there. And no one knows what‚Äôs happening. So that, of course, everybody‚Äôs had challenges with COVID. But trying to launch a cross border financial services company, when suddenly all of the borders all over the world are closed, and raise money to do that was really hard. We figured out the compliance regulatory work and now we‚Äôre working on customer acquisition and trying to convince the customer base that we‚Äôre working with to use our service and doing in a way, now where it‚Äôs all digital, because we can‚Äôt go door to door, we can‚Äôt have a sales staff out talking to people because of COVID because of this restriction. So we‚Äôre trying to really adapt to the new world that we‚Äôre in, but have been able to convince about 2000 customers already to join the platform and make transactions every day. So we‚Äôre growing fairly quickly. But still, I think figuring a lot of that out.\nAnand 9:03 That makes a lot of sense. I think that‚Äôs helpful to understand it. And it sounds like there are a lot of challenges along the way. But you know, it‚Äôs just the beginning, just like any startup, there‚Äôs going to be challenges.\nNat 9:14 I think getting something out there really helps. We spent so much time talking to investors, pitching at pitch competitions. They‚Äôre great, at some of we‚Äôve raised a fair amount of money, winning some of those pitch competitions. But until you have a product out there and a customer base, it‚Äôs all kind of hypothetical. This is who we think is gonna use it. This is how we think they‚Äôre going to use it. And so now we‚Äôve got that great data to back a lot of our assumptions up and it‚Äôs much easier to go out to investors and pitch and talk about it. So that would be another thing is the quicker you can get into market and get a product or service out there in front of your customers and have real stories about what‚Äôs happening, that helps. I wish we would have done that a little sooner but got tied up in the regulation stuff.\n**Anand 9:58 **Well, you I guess you got to figure that out when you‚Äôre moving money around.\nNat 10:01 Yeah didn‚Äôt want to go to jail or anything.\nAnand 10:04 Yeah, that‚Äôs never fun.\nNat 10:06 Or lose people‚Äôs money.\nAnand 10:07 Yep, exactly. Okay. No, that makes sense. And, you know, one, I thought I thought it was intriguing that you mentioned the difference between impact investors and traditional VCs. So one is, one is afraid of technology, the other one is afraid of the African market. But it does sound like if you can prove to people that, hey, the African market has legs and you can really make a business there, you can continue to convince VCs, to then put more money in.\nNat 10:37 Yeah, and that‚Äôs the hope, I think, we‚Äôve fortunately seen growing interest with VCs in the US and Europe, in startups within Africa. And one great one that‚Äôs in our space is a company called Chipper Cash, which Joe Montana in the US invested in their Seed round. And then most recently, Jeff Bezos, his fund, invested in their Series A, I think they raised about $30 million. And they‚Äôre in East Africa and starting to expand to West Africa. In similar concept of this digital wallet to help people move funds like a PayPal or Venmo. We‚Äôre much more focused on the lower income, that cross border, the refugee use case. And so our wallet is both smartphone and non smartphone enabled, so you don‚Äôt have to have a smartphone to do it. And so targeting the 2.4 billion people around the world who don‚Äôt have smartphones to access our service. We‚Äôre hoping that that investment and gets a little bit more interest and excitement from the rest of the VC community in the US and in Europe, across Africa. So we haven‚Äôt seen that quite yet, but I think that‚Äôs the plan and you know, approaching this as a for profit business, because the thought is we can attract more capital, we can invest in our technology, we can invest in our team and ultimately deliver a lower cost service to our customer base.\nAnand 12:01 Yep that‚Äôs pretty cool. It sounds like you guys are on your way.\nNat 12:07 Hopefully we‚Äôll figure it out.\nMission, Culture &amp; Team\nAnand 12:10 Well, that gets me to the next one. You talked a little bit about team as well. So what is Leaf Global‚Äôs mission? And how do you create a culture within your team that embodies it?\nNat 12:22 Yeah, and that was really, it‚Äôs important for every company, but that was very important with me with my last company, in Kenya with Juhudi, as we‚Äôre a very mission driven company. And we were able to attract talent, brilliant people from Google from McKinsey, to come and work for us for either free or very little. And being able to create those opportunities and hire and build a team around that mission can be very powerful. And so I‚Äôve been trying to do that also at Leaf to create our mission and some of that culture. And so our broader mission is to provide economic security to the stateless and excluded, keeping that pretty open starting with refugees and migrants, but there‚Äôs cross border traders, there are many other others that could use our services. And so as a starting point, and then building the team. I was able to attract a lot of students at Vanderbilt, grad students and undergrads who aligned well with that mission of using technology, and particularly exploring this new blockchain technology that‚Äôs exciting, but also applying it to a very big social challenge of helping refugees and migrants who are fleeing across borders. And looking at our customer base. another piece that we‚Äôve been working on this is before COVID, as you know, us as a company, as an institution, not really being grounded or starting in a location. So being mobile, being flexible, being virtual and remote. Now, that‚Äôs becoming common.\nAnand 13:55 Pretty much for everybody.\nNat 14:00 Yeah. So, but that‚Äôs created a lot of challenges for me to create that culture in a much more intentional, as everyone‚Äôs discovering now, it‚Äôs hard to stay connected to your team and keep the work going when you‚Äôre on Zoom all the time and remote. So I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something we‚Äôve totally figured out quite yet. I was much better at it when we had an office and everyone could just socialize and connect and really align to that mission. So I‚Äôm trying to do that now in a more virtual setting all over the world. We have team members in the US and Rwanda and Kenya and also now in Chile as another one of our markets is we‚Äôre looking at.\nAnand 14:34 Cool. And are there any particular techniques that you‚Äôve been using to try to keep the team this is, you know, one to understand how you‚Äôre doing it, at Leaf Global but also, you know, frankly, personally, I‚Äôd love to learn what are the techniques that are working for you guys?\nNat 14:51 Yeah. And I don‚Äôt know. I think the one thing that we have found that works has been working well is getting our word out there participating in these presentations, the pitch competitions speaking with schools and universities. And then from that we do attract a lot of interest from students who both connect with the mission and are passionate about the mission, but also bring some of the technical expertise and trying to find a mix of those. And some of our best staff and most aligned staff have just come from that just being attracted to the work that we‚Äôre doing and really passionate about what we‚Äôre doing, but also bring some of the technical skills. So that‚Äôs the first part you sort of screening and finding those staff and then trying to cultivate that culture as much as we can. We do have our weekly team calls, we have some rituals in those team calls and trying to make sure that we do structure time around non-agenda specific meetings and talks. And I‚Äôve also been doing a lot of one on one calls with the staff. And I think that‚Äôs helping, but it‚Äôs still not the same for being in person trying to develop the culture that way, but really trying to find that time for unstructured conversation, getting to know people, I think that‚Äôs really helpful then we can build that culture as a team.\nAnand 16:08 Yeah. I think the hardest part is what people call water cooler talk, right? Just when you‚Äôre getting some food, getting some coffee. I think that‚Äôs really hard to replicate.\nNat 16:20 Yeah and those are the interactions that I really do think creates those bonds with the staff and helps drive some of that culture. So being intentional and structuring that time is real key.\nDoing Well &amp; Business Model\nAnand 16:31 Totally. Well, I was thinking, we talked a lot about culture, we talked a lot about mission, we talked about team. I wanted to go into the next part, which is Doing Well. So what makes your business sustainable in the short and long term? What‚Äôs your business model?\nNat 16:48 Yeah, and that one, I feel like we got all this new stuff that we‚Äôre working on, that‚Äôs unknown, that‚Äôs untested. The business model we‚Äôre borrowing from banks and from money transfer companies. And so just doing a transaction fee, and then a foreign exchange spread. And so the transaction fee; it‚Äôs free to put money onto your Leaf wallet as a customer, but we would charge a 1% fee for withdrawing those funds onto a mobile money wallet or into a bank account or into another one of our partners that does cash payouts.\nAnand 17:21 So this is a general transfer fee across any entities.\nNat 17:25 Any of our networks. Yeah, exactly. So not particularly expensive but something and the thought there is to generate revenue, but also to encourage people to keep money on the platform and a Leaf to Leaf transaction is free. So if somebody else has a Leaf account, you can send that money to their account for free. And then if you‚Äôre moving money within the wallets across our different currencies that we support, we charge a spread, so a foreign exchange spread. So what we‚Äôre getting from the banks and from our partners, we‚Äôre adding a 4% fee on top of that, and that‚Äôs the same model that MoneyGram and Worldremit and all the others use. They usually embed a bit of an exchange rate spread when you‚Äôre making that foreign exchange transaction. So those are the two main ones. We also sell, starting next week, airtime on the app. That was something that our customers really wanted is being able to buy airtime and prepaid minutes for call time. And so we‚Äôre able to buy that at wholesale rates and then deliver it through our wallet on our exchanges there.\nAnand 18:28 So that‚Äôs not a direct 1% fee. That‚Äôs gonna be a little different because that you‚Äôre buying it wholesale. Okay, got it. So there‚Äôs some margin there. Okay.\nNat 18:38 There‚Äôs a big market there too. The whole world of prepaid minutes is really an interesting one. Sort of hard to think about but yeah, that‚Äôs probably going to be a smaller revenue source for us, but certainly something that‚Äôs helpful for our customers. And then as we‚Äôre developing the wallet, my background has all been in lending and microfinance in Kenya, I‚Äôve always seen that opportunity before layering on a lending, a responsible lending products on our wallets so to really help that refugee or migrant access a loan to purchase an assets or to work on a business. That‚Äôs very transformative for a customer base. And I think, especially if you do it well, and what‚Äôs great with our wallet is we‚Äôre already gathering all this transaction data from our customers. And so we can use that to build credit scores and to do the lending very cheaply. And yeah, I think very responsibly. That‚Äôs the next step and extra revenue stream.\nAnand 19:32 That‚Äôs huge, right? So in that case, the data moat is is actually this concept that if people are using it for a while then and these are unbanked generally your customers so in that case, they would not have a credit score or any sort of score otherwise. And so lending would be only really possible if somebody could then score how good they are at repaying it.\nNat 19:53 Yep, yep, exactly. And even if they do have mobile money accounts, that transaction data is spread across all those different networks, whereas we‚Äôre able to capture all of those transactions in one place. So there‚Äôs also some exciting things that we‚Äôre experimenting with around group guarantees. So still using that Grameen Bank microfinance model, where you could get a group of 10 or 20, people who are all guaranteeing a loan or putting in a small amount to guarantee your loan for an individual. We can do that very cheaply leveraging some of the native functionality of blockchain to be able to secure those guarantees. So you could essentially crowd source your loan, and guarantee a portion of that with all of your friends and they would only maybe do a few dollars of guaranteeing on that loan, depending what they‚Äôre comfortable with. And then that puts also a little more social pressure on them.\nAnand 20:41 So that‚Äôs like peer to peer lending?\nNat 20:44 Yeah, but it‚Äôs more on the guarantee side. So we would be providing the loan, it‚Äôs just your friends in case you don‚Äôt pay back the loan, they‚Äôre pledging a bit of collateral. Not much, not where we‚Äôre gonna be putting other people in debt if you‚Äôre not able to pay the loan. But that‚Äôs something that we‚Äôve been experimenting with and is now possible to do very cheaply and securely on some of the blockchain platforms.\nAnand 21:05 That‚Äôs really cool. Okay, so the the guaranteeing is done, kind of peer to peer with a group of people, but then the money is still coming from Leaf Global for example.\nNat 21:14 Yeah.\nBalancing Shareholder Value with Mission\nAnand 21:16 Got it. Wow, very interesting. So one question I always like to ask is, how do you balance shareholder value - you‚Äôre a for profit company, VC backed - with your mission and culture?\nNat 21:30 Yes and that is a dilemma facing a lot of social enterprises as they‚Äôre growing, expanding and drifting from their mission. And it‚Äôs very much tied, as you suggested to that funding base. And that was my experience with Juhudi Kilimo. With Kenya, we sourced our capital from impact investors thinking that this is a great way to preserve our mission. And I do think that‚Äôs helpful, I think a longer term, more effective way of doing that is to try to structure your business and your markets, so that you‚Äôre providing that service as a social enterprise. If you start to change that mission or go up market, you run into more competition. So that was what we ran into at Juhudi Kilimo is serving those rural, low income smallholder farmers was a big market. And if we wanted to go up market and do bigger loans to more urban farmers, it might be a little more lucrative, but we would run head on into competition with other banks and other microfinance institutions. So we had that sort of defensible moat, around our market that was also very much intertwined with our social mission. I‚Äôm trying to do something similar with Leaf in that nobody‚Äôs providing, sadly, financial services to our customer base that it is seen as a high risk, mobile undocumented low-income group.\nAnand 22:52 Well, I mean, there‚Äôs no data on it. I mean, just saying that you shouldn‚Äôt lend to these people purely because there‚Äôs no data currently. But if there were data, then that would change the game.\nNat 23:05 Exactly and there is some growing research that‚Äôs available out there on our market, and Tufts University has put out a really great one showing that this is a bankable market. And so that is what we‚Äôre focusing on and is a big reason why looking at refugees and migrants because nobody else is. And we believe that there is a tremendous opportunity here for financial services, then also you get these very strong communities and networks and word of mouth, which we‚Äôre also starting to see a spread Leaf and the work that we‚Äôre doing that carries a lot of trust. So kind of embedding that within the market and within the business model, I think it‚Äôs helpful. And then then you‚Äôre less concerned about where your capital is coming from. And in theory, they‚Äôre not going to push you in one direction or another. If it‚Äôs really well structured, but that‚Äôs always a risk. And that‚Äôs, especially with Silicon Valley capital and the returns that they‚Äôre looking for and you talk to Branch International or Tala, both fabulous companies, great founders, I think they were probably both pushed in more of that commercial returns side and have had a lot of backlash in the media because of that. So we‚Äôre trying to avoid some of that if we can.\nAnand 24:11 Yeah, it does seem to some degree inevitable. But yeah, it is tough. I think one thing that‚Äôs intriguing to me is that there‚Äôs always this, this tension in a VC-backed business, especially VC-backed social enterprise particular, where you‚Äôre gonna have conflicting motives. Because shareholder value is one thing and that that one‚Äôs pretty clear. It‚Äôs like, okay, financial, hey, you got to get metrics - you got to do this, you got to do that. And then there‚Äôs social mission. And so the more you can quantify or tie the two together, it seems like that‚Äôs sort of the best way to try to avoid some of these conflicts.\nNat 24:50 Yep. But that‚Äôs also really hard. If you talk to any of the other social enterprises I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had on your show it‚Äôs measuring that impact is really challenging and can be quite expensive as well. It‚Äôd be a drain on the company. But I do think that‚Äôs the way to do it have great metrics on on all of those. It‚Äôs, in theory easier now than it ever has been to collect some of that information to help you really drive that mission.\nAnand 25:15 Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of been a little bit all over the place actually, so far with the founders we‚Äôve talked to, I mean, some people have mentioned, yeah, they have faced the, you know, conflict immediately. Some people have said they haven‚Äôt faced much conflict, we‚Äôve been really lucky. And, you know, they‚Äôve been moving us quite, you know, along well. So I think that there is a, it does feel like it‚Äôs constantly evolving, no matter where you‚Äôre at, as you grow, you got to keep thinking about it, keep, coming up with new ways to to align those two.\nNat 25:42 Yep, absolutely. Right. And, yeah, the metrics or the information that you can gather that also inform the business helps , too. So if you‚Äôre looking at, you know, your impact, or who your customer base is, what sort of, you know, life that your customers are experiencing, and how that‚Äôs changing what they value. And those are all good business metrics too to be able to design new products, and new services, we leverage a lot of that at Juhudi is just surveying and getting to know the customers really well, and where do they spend their money? And how can we be supportive. And that‚Äôs how we developed a lot of our solar and energy loans. It‚Äôs just understanding our customer base a little bit more about their home what they need.\nDoing Good\nAnand 26:21 Yeah, that I guess is the most important, right, keep listening to your customer. The rest will fall into place. Cool. So I was thinking we could go next into Doing Good. So in 10 years, when Leaf Global is a huge success, what global challenge will the company have helped solve?\nNat 26:40 Well, and this was all inspired from the work that we did with this Hult Prize and seeing how massive the global refugee crisis is, and how many more people are facing potential displacements. There‚Äôs about 80 million at the moment and another 100 to 150 million that could be displaced and leave their homes anytime. That‚Äôs everything from political situations, or environmental. And there‚Äôs still not a great way to carry your money across borders in most of the conflict zones that we‚Äôve looked at. And so in 10 years, if we‚Äôre able to provide that low cost secure way for refugees and migrants to send and store money, within their families, and friends, they‚Äôre less dependent on those aid agencies, I think that‚Äôs a success. And so that would be our goal is every country in the world if you‚Äôre leaving, or if you‚Äôre thinking about leaving, because you know, everyone‚Äôs a normal person until they‚Äôre forced to flee, and then suddenly, now you‚Äôre a refugee. So there are still customers, they still have assets and hopes and dreams and want to bring those to the nnext country. And so being able to provide that service to anyone anywhere in the world. I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre moving towards.\nAnand 27:56 Got it. Okay. So, if I understand correctly, would it be any, eventually you want to solve solve this for all ‚Äúunbankable‚Äù, people who are not being served by large banks today? Is that accurate?\nNat 28:11 Yeah, I think somebody else has has a bank account, or has even a debit card, ATM card, they probably don‚Äôt need our services. But that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre starting, that we can let the others come down market to provide services to some of those other customers. But yeah, we really do believe that there‚Äôs a tremendous opportunity with this market,\nAnand 28:31 You mentioned 2.4 billion, right as the as the\nNat 28:34 Number of non-smartphone users. Yep.\nAnand 28:37 That‚Äôs incredible. I did not realize that stat existed, that‚Äôs pretty wild.\nNat 28:43 We get questions all the time about, oh, you know, smartphones are everywhere, they‚Äôre becoming cheaper, use it. And that‚Äôs just not what we‚Äôve seen in a lot of our markets. In fact, sometimes it‚Äôs the reverse, there‚Äôs a higher demand for non smartphones, because data is so expensive. Or you‚Äôre in a place where you can‚Äôt charge a smartphone every every night, you don‚Äôt have the access to the power. So, you know, the designing and developing for both of those phones, I think is going to be really valuable going forward.\nAnand 29:10 Yeah, I mean, that‚Äôs a third of the population! That‚Äôs wild! So, you‚Äôve talked a little bit about Doing Good. Why choose this particular for profit social enterprise versus a nonprofit model?\nNat 29:28 Yeah. And that‚Äôs a big dilemma, too, is when I question a lot with the last company, in my previous answer would always be because you can scale quicker you can attract capital and then invest in the team, invest technology, deliver that lower cost service. That being said in the last 10 years, I think we‚Äôve seen some very large nonprofit models do well and scale. I think the big one in East Africa within my networks was One Acre Fund. They‚Äôve scaled tremendously to millions of farmers, and they‚Äôve done it through that nonprofit, traditional philanthropy approach, so I think that that is still a way to, to do it. And then long term sustainability, right is another another way, if you‚Äôre a for profit business, you‚Äôre going to be around for longer. But some of the longest standing institutions in the world are nonprofits, if it is religious organizations or universities, academic institutions, governments. So I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the answer anymore. I still think that being able to attract the talent, the brightest people who want to work on hard problems, maybe don‚Äôt want to give up that that big job as a consultant, or a lawyer or banker, or especially now in tech, it‚Äôs incredibly competitive, trying to find talent. So being able to pay a little bit more for your talent base or offering equity, that sometimes I think could be the thing that pushes people over the edge to then come work with us. So that‚Äôs the hope we‚Äôll see maybe talking in 10 years, we‚Äôll see if we‚Äôve grown any more or expanded, maybe there‚Äôs some great nonprofit models out there that have scaled better than we have.\nAnand 31:07 That‚Äôs incredible, because as far as at least we‚Äôve had on this podcast, we‚Äôve definitely heard a lot of the same things you mentioned. Talent, capital, growth, all of those, but never really heard that, you know, there might actually be another model. Right. nonprofits, at least for the people that come on the show, they‚Äôve mentioned that they chose for profit, because that was their assumption. So talent, capital growth. But you bring up a good point that maybe that‚Äôs not the case. Maybe there are sustainable nonprofit models. And I think it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs to be seen, perhaps there‚Äôs a maybe there‚Äôs data out there that says, you know, X percent of nonprofits last and X percent of for profits don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs probably highly skewed, there‚Äôs probably so many for profits out there. So I‚Äôm really curious to see that data, but it sounds like, at least for you, it was you did have sort of that idea that it was talent and capital and growth that was why you chose the for-profit model.\nNat 32:08 Yeah. Yep. That was it. I think I still believe that that‚Äôs the way to do it as hard as it is. I mean, both are hard. It‚Äôs tough attracting capital on both ends. Yeah, it‚Äôs a challenge. But yes, I still believe in that concept and being able to leverage that. So, we‚Äôll see.\nAdvice for Listeners\nAnand 32:36 First of all, this was incredible. I thought your story was super incredible. The way that you‚Äôve thought about it, and what you guys are doing it Leaf Global is amazing. I wanted to end with some advice for the listeners. What advice would you give to founders who are trying to build a Doing Well by Doing Good social enterprise, and specifically in Africa, and then of course, even outside of that, or professionals looking to work for one?\nNat 33:02 So for the for the founders, you know, the book that I always loved was The Hard Things about Hard Things , Ben Horowitz‚Äôs book. It‚Äôs a hard struggle, it is brutal, there‚Äôs no doubt about it, you‚Äôre gonna get shut down, kicked around, failed, and really just needing to persevere and keep going. as awful as that is, sometimes. That‚Äôs so critical. And I still have a hard time with that. It‚Äôs like, gosh, can this get any worse, we were just about to close the seed round, and then COVID hit and then we get, you know, customers. At first, we had a hard time getting customers now we‚Äôve got so many transactions, that our servers are crashing, it‚Äôs just one thing after another. That is never gonna change that struggle, right. So to kind of get through that and to persevere and to see that. And I also feel like don‚Äôt always listen to advice from investors or anyone else. If you believe it, go with it and prove them wrong or get data, talk to the customers like that‚Äôs going to be key. And then for people looking to get into the sector and get involved the advice I would always give, especially if you‚Äôre right out of college university, try to get some of that big business experience work for a big brand name, if it‚Äôs a Google or Facebook or McKinsey or the banks, as awful as that may be. I think that one helps broaden the network. But also in theory, you‚Äôre getting some of that technical capabilities and skill that goes very well with the passion. And I think some of the more successful people I‚Äôve seen in the space have gone into consulting or banking before and then come into social enterprise versus going direct right out of undergrad. Then the other thing is just to go and volunteer to just show up. I would always give that advice especially in Kenya people are looking to get involved more with what we‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre going to have more success being there on the ground, networking and talking to people. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs changed now. Maybe there‚Äôs more opportunities for you.\nAnand 35:02 Yeah, virtual volunteering.\nNat 35:05 Right, Exactly! So it‚Äôs less less costly on the organization‚Äôs. So there‚Äôs there‚Äôs more need, I guess the other thing is social enterprises don‚Äôt generally do a lot of recruiting as much as going to career fairs. And so you almost have to seek them out and really push and you are susceptible that to just finding, it‚Äôs hard to find time to really recruit, promote, correctly, or use a lot of the big job sites. And I think our best success has been people who‚Äôve just reached out to us directly. So there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs interested in working with blockchain and refugees and FinTech and global issues like this, feel free to reach out.\nAnand 35:44 Absolutely. And and we‚Äôll drop some links in the in the show notes as well.\nNat 35:49 Great.\nAnand 35:50 Well that was great advice. So I thought, it‚Äôs a lot to digest. Yeah. But yeah, I was very floored by this interview. So thank you very much for for doing this. Very much. appreciate the time.\nNat 36:06 Well, thanks again for hosting me. And I really love the work that you‚Äôre doing in bringing the speakers together and big believer in the opportunity. So thank you for including me. Appreciate it. Thanks for checking out my book, too. Of course, yeah, shamelessly. But I did put a lot of my, all of my failures in there.\nAnand 36:26 Yeah, it‚Äôs very helpful for anybody who wants to start a business in Kenya in particular, it‚Äôs Creating a Cash Cow in Kenya. And it‚Äôs all about your adventures of building Juhudi Kilimo and all of your crazy adventures in Africa. So it was pretty cool.\n\nNat 36:42 Okay, well, thanks, glad you enjoyed it!\nAnand 36:46 Thank you so much.

This time we‚Äôre trying something different ‚Äî chatting with those that fund the founders we‚Äôve chatted with in the past.\nFounders have a unique passion for their craft, but what about the investors that exclusively invest in these types of companies? How do they think about quantifying the combination of financial, social, and environmental impact of these firms? In this episode and subsequent ones we will hear directly from the people making these funding decisions.\nIn a previous post on the blog, we defined Impact Investing and described how it is Doing Well by Doing Good because it is focused on generating _ positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return._\nOne of the early stage impact investment funds we highlighted in that post, Elevar Equity, serves emerging economies in India and Latin America and has a unique approach to evaluating their companies called the ‚ÄúElevar Method‚Äù.\nWe had an insightful conversation with Sandeep Farias , a former lawyer and Managing Director at Elevar Equity ‚Äî so much so that we broke it up into two episodes.\n\nPart 1: The Elevar Method &amp; the COVID crisis in India\nCheck out the full episode below, click below on the key sections to listen to those snippets, or read the key points from each section for details üòÄ\n[1:32] Elevar‚Äôs Starting Journey and Ethos\n\n\nBegan ~10 years ago as a collaboration across Indian &amp; Latin American markets\n\n\nHand‚Äôs on and focused on in-the-field learning via field visits with customers\n\n\nInnovation realized by distribution rather than just product or service\n\n\n[7:22] The Elevar Method asks the question‚ÄúCan you deliver something effectively, profitably, and affordably?‚Äù and comes in 3 parts\n\n\n_ LAhWS framework_ - Low Average Revenue per User [ARPU] (LA), high Wallet Share (hWS) which means high affordability while also being essential for the end user\n\n\nCustomer Business Model - Profitability (profit margin), affordability (customer margin) and distribution (impact leverage) together enable businesses to best position themselves to be a sustainable business while also making an impact. In other words, the business imperative and impact imperative are inextricably tied together.\n\n\n\n\n_ Scale_ - Twin flywheels for customers and business working together enable sustainability over time. Positive accountability, great unit economics, and distribution working alongside product enables companies achieve scale.\n\n\n[20:23] Impact vs. Non-impact businesses\n\n\nNon-impact businesses are purely based on maximization of profitability\n\n\nImpact businesses additionally have affordability as a key differentiator\n\n\n[21:45] COVID Crisis in India and its Impact\n\n\nThe second wave has been a tsunami ‚Äî everyone in the Indian diaspora knows at least one person who has passed from COVID.\n\n\nElevar‚Äôs portfolio entrepreneurs have come together to help their customers and employees. Seasoned entrepreneurs can better handle the volatility of the market caused by COVID.\n\n\nCOVID has created lots of stories that will motivate new entrepreneurs\n\n\nCOVID has unearthed new opportunities in the healthcare and finance sectors\n\n\n[ 28:20 ] Can impact investing help prevent or avert crises like COVID?\n\nImpact investing cannot avert the crisis, but it brings together communities, and COVID has shown the strength of the community through collaboration between the entrepreneurs, employees, and customers.\n\n[ 31:57 ] Can entrepreneurs help customers and employees during crises like COVID?\n\n\nOrganizations have limited options short-term options, but human ingenuity still comes together to provide immediate relief.\n\n\nIn the long-term, organizations can help by supporting their customers via their products (e.g. high quality two-wheelers, loans for agricultural farmers)\n\n\n\nPart 2: Examples of DWDG companies in Elevar‚Äôs Portfolio and Advice for Listeners\nCheck out the full podcast episode below, click below on the key sections to listen to those snippets, or read the key points from each section for details üòÄ\n[ 1:19 ] Edutech example of a DWDG company in Elevar‚Äôs portfolio\n\nLEAD School works in the mid-market education market fitting both the low ARPU and high Wallet Share criteria (LAhWS) of the Elevar Method and the founders have experience running their own schools in India.\n\n[ 6:42 ] Can LAhWS type businesses sustain as the middle class grows?\n\n\nWhile more groups are moving into the middle class and aspirations grow, LAhWS customers are simply demanding more services opening opportunities for new businesses.\n\n\nAs this happens, standard investors and impact investing are quickly converging driving more capital to impact investing.\n\n\n[ 13:14 ] What is Elevar‚Äôs key differentiation among others in the space?\n\n\nElevar Equity is differentiated in their adherence to the Elevar Method for evaluation and a focus on a limited number of investments per year in the Indian and Latin American market.\n\n\nMarkets Elevar invests in are not winner-take-all markets meaning that there are lot of opportunities for new capital making it less competitive and more collaborative.\n\n\n[ 18:40 ] Transportation example of a DWDG company in Elevar‚Äôs portfolio\n\n\nWheelsEMI provides second-hand scooter (commonly referred to as ‚Äútwo wheelers‚Äù) financing for the Indian market.\n\n\nScooter availability is a key driver for economic mobility for low income communities and WheelsEMI is making them more affordable\n\n\nWheelsEMI also has a leg up on the coming electric scooter revolution since they can start from scratch rather than worry about existing infrastructure in India.\n\n\n[ 22:36 ] Community dynamics at scale is as important as technology at scale in emerging markets &amp; the DWDG portfolio companies that embody this\n\n\nSammunati helps farmers in India join farmer producer organizations by leveraging social capital within those markets to develop partnerships driving growth in their businesses.\n\n\nNuvemshop is a Shopify for the LatAm market leveraging unique community dynamics to help SMBs to better connect to their customers.\n\n\n[ 25:28 ] Business flywheel and customer flywheel of the Elevar Method are a good map for Doing Well and Doing Good\n\nCustomer value (driven by value value and affordability) is critical to continue the business flywheel due to the dependence on social goodwill\n\n[ 27:52 ] Conflicts between creating shareholder value and Doing Good\n\n\nConflicts always come up, but can be minimized by analyzing the company via the Elevar Method to identify alignment between business and customer value\n\n\nThere is no standard metric for impact, Elevar looks at each company‚Äôs business to determine the ROE for the fund.

It‚Äôs been a while so this welcome is particularly special and I‚Äôm quite excited to share this episode with you!\n\nThis time we return to our typical programming with Allan Tollo, the CEO of MyFugo ‚Äî a company focused on helping farmers in Kenya create a livelihood for their families through financial empowerment. In short ‚Äî they focus on making a profit for the very clear purpose to help rural dairy farmers in Kenya, a group that has largely been ignored by many markets and who face a significant barrier to financial inclusion.\n\nAs usual you can check out the full episode below , but we‚Äôve take the time to break it down a bit below so read through the summary and click to the parts you‚Äôre interested in. While in the past we‚Äôve take the time to give you full transcripts of each episode, we realized that summaries were more effective. So like last time, we‚Äôve done the same. Hope you enjoy üòÄ\n\nCompany Background\n[0:57] MyFugo‚Äôs Mission and Starting Journey\n\n\nMyFugo is named after the Swahili word ‚Äúmifugo‚Äù meaning ‚Äúlivestock‚Äù.\n\n\nMyFugo helps rural farmers in Kenya via microloans and IoT technology (e.g. cow collars) to create a sustainable livelihood and improve financial inclusion within the economy.\n\n\nAllan tried to create his own dairy farm when between jobs as an IT professional and MyFugo was born from that lived experience and confirmation with dairy farmers in the market.\n\n\nMyFugo‚Äôs MVP was an app to track dairy production of cows, but customers weren‚Äôt willing to pay. They needed to finance cows and improve the efficiency of the cows so MyFugo now provides cow collars and micro-loans to help the farmers end-to-end.\n\n\n[7:37] What challenges did MyFugo have to overcome to get to where it is?\n\n\nSeed financing is notoriously difficult in Africa because there is little data to validate whether the business works, so investors consider it a black box.\n\n\nMyFugo had to bootstrap and to find a great team aligned with the mission but also willing to take a lower-than-market pay.\n\n\n[ 13:12 ] What is MyFugo‚Äôs mission and culture?\n\n\nMyFugo‚Äôs mission is to leverage technology to address the first 3 key UN SDG goals focused on poverty, hunger, and well-being of all humans.\n\n\nMyFugo‚Äôs culture is to maintain a customer-centric mindset and to approach problems by maintaining that nothing is impossible.\n\n\nThis mission and culture has enabled MyFugo to achieve high customer retention (&gt; 90%) and develop partnerships with other companies that add value to their customers.\n\n\nDoing Well\n[ 20:25 ] What is MyFugo‚Äôs business model to become profitable?\n\n\nMyFugo makes money via standard fees and interest revenue on their daily micro-loans from their farmers, and they use group dynamics to reduce the risk via co-guaranteeing from other members.\n\n\nMyFugo also has a standard one-time service fee for new dairy farmers who apply to assess the condition of the farm, the experience of the farmer, and gauge the risk of the insured.\n\n\nMyFugo offers loans for a number of different types of cows and leverages group knowledge from all farmers to reduce the overall loan risk (e.g. how to detail with East Coast Fever in cows).\n\n\nDoing Good\n[ 28:27 ] What global challenge will MyFugo have helped solve in 10 years?\n\n\nMyFugo hopes to enable small holder farmers to live with dignity, reduce poverty among this population and to empower economic livelihood and independence.\n\n\n_ Specific Example:_ MyFugo has helped a group of women called ‚ÄúNo Sex for Fish‚Äù who previously had to trade sexual favors to feed their families, but now with MyFugo have been empowered to be economically independent.\n\n\n[ 30:32 ] Why build a for-profit entity vs. a non-profit?\n\n\nNon-profits are funded by donors but are only short term solutions and don‚Äôt last for more than a few years. For profits can build a more sustainable long-term solution through growth and a good incentive structure.\n\n\nPrevious non-profit attempts in the dairy farming market have largely been unsuccessful because 50% of cows would die since the farmer isn‚Äôt incentivized to keep it alive (non-profits act like one-time handouts).\n\n\nMyFugo is focused on ‚Äúdollars and cents making sense‚Äù ‚Äî that is, attaching a monetary outcome to owning the cow, thus increasing the success rate and sustainability of creating livelihoods for farmers.\n\n\n[ 35:32 ] How do you avoid conflicts between shareholder value and mission?\n\n\nMost important is to align your mission with the correct investor who have patient capital so they can weather the storm.\n\n\nAlso aligning social impact KPIs with the financial KPIs is key. For MyFugo that is increasing the overall production of milk with the revenue for the business.\n\n\nAdvice for the Listeners\n[ 39:53 ] Allan‚Äôs advice for startup founders and employees\n\n\nCarpe diem. It‚Äôs never too early to start. You will never be ready for what comes so start today so you start to make progress.\n\n\nThe value of the product lies with your customers so don‚Äôt wait for your product to be perfect, get it out there ASAP to gather customer feedback.\n\n\nIn order of importance goes: 1) employees, 2) customers, and 3) shareholders. Companies are made up of their people and are critical to its success so take care of them.\n\n\n\nWishing you all a Sunday as fun as this guy‚Äôs and an amazing week ahead üòÄ\n\nIf you have any feedback reach out via email or tweet us at @dwdgsf.\nUntil next time\n‚úåüèΩ Anand"},"20211114-vikram-gandhi-managing-partner-asha":{"title":"üéôÔ∏è Vikram Gandhi - Managing Partner @ Asha Impact & HBS Professor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"original link: thegoodaipod.substack.com/p/-vikram-gandhi-managing-partner-asha\nüéôÔ∏è Vikram Gandhi - Managing Partner @ Asha Impact &amp; HBS Professor\nImpact investing in India, DWDG portfolio companies, and sustaining impact\nNov 14, 2021\nüëãüèΩ Welcome to Doing Well by Doing Good , a newsletter and podcast series highlighting the startups aiming to be profitable with a purpose.\nSign up for the newsletter\n\n_ Happy Sunday folks!_ It‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve heard from me ‚Äî turns out I had a few personal updates, I got engaged üíç and ran the Boston Marathon ü¶Ñ .

Asha Trust is an advisory entity to help drive large-scale change via policy to mobilize the government, which Vikram describes as the world‚Äôs largest impact investor.\n\n\n_ Example : Asha Impact invested in Janaadhar and Vastu ‚Äîtwo affordable housing portfolio companies ‚Äî which provide mortgages to the bottom half of the population and illuminated the broken parts of the affordable housing system. Since affordable housing is a policy goal for the Indian government, Asha Trust worked with local municipalities to catalyze policy change and increase investment dollars back into affordable housing initiatives further aiding the mission of Janaadhar and Vastu._\n\n\n**[[11:22](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx)] **Asha Impact Fund thesis &amp; mission\n\n\nAsha Impact is focused on businesses that serve the ~700M aspiring or rising middle class in India. This is unique since most investment firms focus on the top ~100M and government and non-profit spending focuses on the bottom ~500M living around or below the poverty line.\n\n\nAsha Impact invests in companies servicing multiple industries ‚Äî fintech, housing, micro-finance, agriculture, etc. but typically has a bend towards financial products.\n\n\nOnce Asha Impact decides a company has an adequate impact to the right target customer, they focus on standard financial metrics as any traditional investor would (e.g. IRR, KPIs, etc)\n\n\n[ [21:40](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1300 open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1300) ] Example of portfolio companies and their business models\n\n\nVarthana is a financial services and inclusion company providing student and school loans servicing middle class schools. Asha Impact invested and helped the company grow to 5000 schools across India, then exited as it entered a private equity growth phase.\n\n\nNepra is a circular-economy waste management company that enables financial inclusion by providing an income source through local hiring, green waste management, and innovative methods to re-sell recycled plastics. Asha Impact invested in the company early on and continues to hold the position.\n\n\nDoing Well through Asha Impact\n[ [28:01](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1681 open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1681) ] Is there a difference in business models between non-impact companies vs. impact companies?\n\n\nBusiness models are typically pretty similar across these types of companies ‚Äî but the investors and founders have a different mindset in each. For example, the tradeoff between short-term profits vs. long-term value will skew towards long-term impact vs. short-term profits for impact-minded companies. But both ultimately need to have long-term profits to thrive.\n\n\n_Example : Janaadhar had the opportunity to move up market to increase short-term margins, but this would have been mission-drift since it would target a different more affluent target audience which is not in line with their mission. _\n\n\n[ [32:50](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1970 open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=1970) ] Are there ever conflicts at the board level between impact and profits?\n\n\nWhen the board and founders are aligned this goes a lot smoother (this is a common theme across all of our conversations with both founders of DWDG companies and their investors). Often founders prefer to have impact investors on their cap table to be a buffer against traditional investors who might push hard for profits despite it being counter to the mission.\n\n\nCompanies where the impact mission is embedded in the business model for growth (e.g. # of loans for a micro-finance bank) face less conflicts because impact and non-impact investors alike are incentivized to invest.\n\n\nDoing Good through Asha Impact\n[ [34:20](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=2060 open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=2060) ] Based on your experience at Asha Impact, how can Doing Well by Doing Good companies stay true to their mission past the early stages and throughout their life?\n\n\nMaintaining a close relationship between impact and financial returns throughout their lifetime enables impact companies to return the cost of capital, which incentivizes commercial capital and impact investors alike.\n\n\nIdentifying a large enough market with enough growth potential to tackle with an impact mission is key (e.g. targeting the aspiring middle class in India ~700M which is growing in terms of numbers and wallet share)\n\n\nVikram describes 3 types of investments‚Äî A : traditional commercial capital where the company meets traditional financial metrics‚Äî B : philanthropic or charity investments where the company is often non-profit and does not hope to return large margins‚Äîand C : high risk impact investments, the Doing Well by Doing Good companies where impact and profit are tied but aren‚Äôt returning capital consistently yet. Asha Impact and other early impact investors often invest in C , with the hope of turning the companies eventually to A.\n\n\nAdvice for Listeners\n[ [40:40](open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=2440 open.spotify.com/episode/5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx%3Aepisode%3A5oAQs3N9cOHhagvLPjbAUx&amp;t=2440) ] What is some advice you have for founders of Doing Well by Doing Good companies and the investors that invest in them?\n\n\nAs a mission-driven founder, keep focused on the mission but also have a deep focus on the bottom-line ‚Äî without the latter the business cannot survive. Not surprisingly, founders coming out of for-profit businesses historically are more attuned to this given previous experiences.\n\n\nAs an impact investor, be vigilant and maintain strong investment fundamentals when deciding where to invest ‚Äî Doing Well by Doing Good companies cannot sustainably achieve their mission without sound fundamentals, and consequently returns can‚Äôt be made without that.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed the summary above and the episode!

Despite the craziness with Omicron, I hope you had time to relax with family and friends alike. After a long hiatus, we are committing to connect with more DWDG entrepreneurs and investors in the new year!\n\nTo kick this year off, we will recap our latest podcast where we chatted with Brian Trelstad , an HBS professor and Managing Partner at Bridges Fund Management focused on service-based impact investments. We explored the ways in which impact investors enable service-focused portfolio companies across multiple fields.\n\nAs we‚Äôve done in the past, we‚Äôll summarize some of the key points below and link to the part of the podcast that is most relevant. If you want to listen to the full episode click below and enjoy!\n\nBackground\n[ 1:05 ] After graduating from Stanford GSB, Brian Trelstad became the CFO and eventually the CIO of Acumen Fund , a non-profit founded by CEO Jacqueline Novogratz. [Brian‚Äôs Bio]\n\n\nIn 2011, Brian decided to build out a similar impact imperative but in the US. Bridges Fund reached out because they had the same goal as Brian.\n\n\nIn 2014, Brian started the Bridges Sustainable Growth Fund - a commercial fund within Bridges - to invest in impact service-based businesses in the US market.\n\n\nWhy a Commercial Fund over a Nonprofit?\n[ 4:37 ] Impact investment in private capital markets that provide comparable returns with quantifiable impact metrics are a win-win and this is possible in today‚Äôs market.\n\nQuantifiable metrics for impact (e.g. closing the racial and socioeconomic wealth gap, addressing climate change) are still not well-defined, though it has been shown over the last decade that the right incentives attracts more money than a purely nonprofit grant-based funding approach [ _ Brian‚Äôs article on the Impact Investing vs nonprofits_ ]\n\nBridges Fund Thesis &amp; Metrics\n[ 6:56 ] Thesis : Invest in founder-owners of business that operate in the healthcare, education, and sustainability space looking for an aligned partner to help them grow.\n\n\nCurrent State : There are many impact investors at the early stage market and lots of late stage private equity investors getting into the impact investment space.\n\n\nUnique Differentiator : Bridges focuses in the lower-middle market with businesses between $10-30M in revenue.\n\n\nImpact Metrics: Performance indicators are identified in the diligence phase. These vary across businesses though the goal is to identify if the business is doing one of the 3: (1) contributing to a solution, (2) helping stakeholders (e.g. B-corp benchmark) or (3) avoiding harm. Bridges is focused on (1) and will also back businesses doing only (2) but avoids investments that purely are doing (3).\n\n\nExample : Sunrise Treatment Centers is a center to help those with opioid addiction get clean and fits all of (1), (2), and (3). Bridges uses patient census, quality of care, tenure of the patient as a proxy for a score card indicating how well Sunrise is doing on impact.\nMaintaining Impact Through the Investment\n[ 12:07 ] Generally if profit is tied to impact there isn‚Äôt anything special we have to do to incentivize the company to continue, but some special cases exist.\n\n\nNot all impact investors are the same‚Äîthose looking for market rate returns like Bridges and Elevar Equity , and non-profits looking to catalyze the market like Acumen.\n\n\n_ Example_ : Altius Dental is a dental practice for Medicaid patients ‚Äî as they serve more patients their impact and profits grow. As investors it is important to keep them on track by keeping them honest.\n\n\nDWDG Portfolio Companies\n[ 16:21 ] Brian gives a few examples of Doing Well by Doing Good companies they have invested in and how they got connected.\n\n\nSunrise Treatment Centers - opioid addiction center to treat patients focused on a unique combination of norepinephrine treatment and counseling.\n\nHow they invested? Sunrise was selling and ran a process to attract private equity investors, and Bridges initially lost. But it didn‚Äôt go through and a few months later serendipitously they met again and hit it off because of mission alignment\n\n\n\nJames River Home Health and Hospice - founded by a repeat entrepreneur focused on providing quality care for elderly patients\n\nHow they invested? Introduced by Acumen Fund and the founders and Bridges hit it off once they identified their mission-alignment around patient focus.\n\n\n\nDoing Good &amp; Doing Well\n[ 21:16 ] Bridges focuses on service-based companies and first looks at the impact the company‚Äôs service has on an underserved population ‚Äî doing good. Next, they consider the ability of the company to profitably deliver that service ‚Äî i.e. how they do well. Ongoing impact and commercial diligence is done for these businesses across the lifetime of the investment.\n\n\n_ Example_ : Bridges invested in Altius Dental that serves ~40 rural communities in Texas with underserved and largely Medicaid patients because they are delivering impact via their service and are able to do so profitably. A private equity company looking only interested in financial metrics may look at the same investment and may not be willing to take that risk due to reimbursement risk, etc.\n\n\nThe commercial lens is the same as private equity except with a bit more risk tolerance given the impact imperative of the business.\n\n\nConflict between Shareholder Value &amp; Doing Good?\n[ 25:17 ] Brian does not see a difference in shareholder value and impact in their investments but believes that given the impact imperative this does affect the profit margins and thus diminishes shareholder value in the short-term but has long-term value creation\n\n_ Key Insight_ : Impact investment might forego short-term gains for long-term value, whereas traditional investments may have better short-term gains.\n\nAdvice for Listeners\n[ 28:30 ] Brian shared advice and non-advice for three groups: those looking to work for a DWDG company, found a DWDG company, or invest in a DWDG company\n\n\n_ Work_ : Play to your functional strengths and move horizontally within the same functional role to transition companies. Change just one attribute of your job at a time to leverage your previous experiences.\n\n\n_ Found_ : Brian believes that there is no advice needed. If you believe in something and know how to execute go do it! Mission-driven founders will do what they do.\n\n\n_ Invest_ : Determine your return expectations, thesis, timeline and goals. E.g. is it purely risk capital, for your retirement, or are you focused on making a change at any cost?\n\n\n\nThanks for listening!

That is what she and the team at January AI are building.\n\nIn this episode, we explore her journey to reaching that conclusion and explore anecdotes from her long storied career and the critical lessons she learned along the way.\nListen to the whole episode at the link below or check out below the fold for a quick summary of the key ideas and the specific times in the podcast that address them.\n\nBackground &amp; Journey\n[ 1:00 ] January AI‚Äôs mission is to eradicate lifestyle diseases by tracking trends over time, change habits and cutting edge AI.\n[ 2:25 ] What was Noosheen‚Äôs journey to becoming the CEO of January AI?\n\n\nShe was a sales executive at Oracle from ‚Äò85-‚Äô95 doubling sales every year and ruthlessly focused on helping the company become a monopoly in the space.\n\n\nShe was at a personal finance startup in the late 90s for 1 year to empower people to be their own agents and invest.\n\n\nAfter that she began a family office, advised, invested in for-profits and non-profits and did philanthropy for 19 years.\n\n\nIn 2016 she fell into Health and AI by learning about AI and society and figured that building a for-profit that is sustainable, profitable and impactful was the next phase in her career.\n\n\nAfter exploring multiple avenues in the healthtech space, Noosheen fell into the multi-omics space where she found that we could track whole body health to solve chronic conditions like diabetes.\n\n\n[ 9:54 ] Noosheen attributes the journey and January AI to Ikigai - the combination of what you love, what you‚Äôre good at and what the world needs\n\nIkigai along with Design Thinking allows us to ask ourselves the right questions to understand if we are achieving Ikigai in our daily work.\n\n[ 11:56 ] Doing Well by Doing Good is easier to do today than 20 or 30 years ago.\n\n\nA generational shift has occurred where employees and the market don‚Äôt buy that you can do something terrible and cover it with something good [e.g. an oil company exacerbating climate change while donating to cleaning up beaches]\n\n\nIn today‚Äôs world, we don‚Äôt have enough time to do well and do good separately, so doing it together is the most effective use of time.\n\n\nCOVID has brought life and health more into the spotlight and society has latched onto that making Doing Well by Doing Good more prevalent.\n\n\nMission &amp; Culture\n[ 16:10 ] _January AI‚Äôs Mission _is to eradicate lifestyle diseases by tracking trends over time, change habits and cutting edge AI.\n\nJanuary AI‚Äôs Culture : Build a culture by hiring incredibly curious people who are cross-disciplinary, want to build assistive technology and are empathetic to the customer. This is key to achieving the mission.\n\n[ 19:23 ] January AI‚Äôs deep phenotyping of patients and AI analysis of that data helps create more personalized treatments for diabetes.\n\n\nJanuary AI ran a 1.5 year long clinical trial with 1022 patients to measure heart rate monitors and continuous glucose monitors and predict patients‚Äô responses.\n\n\n22% of those with diabetes or pre-diabetes are undiagnosed and AI algorithms help reduce the need for expensive wearables because it predicts how people react to foods and only necessitates expensive wearables for extreme cases.\n\n\nDoing Good\n[24:13] What global challenge do you hope to solve with January AI and what vulnerable population would you help?\n\n\nGlobal Challenge : Obesity and metabolic disease is highly correlated with diabetes. We‚Äôll have over 700M people with diabetes in the world by 2040 and January AI hopes to address this growing and increasingly global challenge (e.g. India &amp; China have growing populations with diabetes)\n\n\nVulnerable Population: Populations with diabetes, pre-diabetes, or that are at-risk of developing either of these due to hereditary factors. Those in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups are especially at risk due to a higher prevalence compared to other groups (e.g. less likely to consume fiber, which leads to higher prevalence of metabolic diseases)\n\n\nHow January AI does good : Personalized monitoring of glucose and other metrics to provide actionable insight into reactions to foods and educating those vulnerable populations about ways they can improve their health.\n\n\nDoing Well\n[ 31:20 ] How is January AI‚Äôs business model differentiated in the market and how are shareholder value and doing good kept in balance?\n\n\nJanuary AI is a startup focused on building a valuable and powerful product even if that means operating at a loss for a while.\n\n\nJanuary AI‚Äôs business model is B2B2C by getting self-insured employers to pay for the app to keep their employees healthy. Adoption is achieved by building an engaging consumer experience that employees love using.\n\n\nJanuary AI balances shareholder value and doing good by having clear lines in the sand (e.g. they will never sell patient‚Äôs data). Since the business model is B2B and the end user is D2C, it‚Äôs important that they are intricately linked, so doing good for patients is also good business practice.\n\n\nJanuary AI has competition but the market is large and continuing to grow. January AI is differentiating through a better AI-powered consumer experience and hopes with it to be able to scale to help the 122M US adults with diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n\n\n[ 38:50 ] How does January AI think about customers who don‚Äôt have wearables? Does January AI need to provide the hardware as well?\n\nJanuary AI does not provide CGMs since they use one-time use enzymes and so cannot be leased (like the workout app Future does with Apple Watches), but instead focuses on identifying the intermittent need for CGMs with advanced AI. In addition the cost of CGMs is continually decreasing which is a positive trend for the business.\n\nFor Profit vs. Non-profit?\n[ 40:43 ] Noosheen studied non-profits for over 20 years and learned they aren‚Äôt sustainable by themselves while for profit businesses are. Both have their merits.\n\n\nNon-profits such as museums are not balancing their books but run on grants and asking for donations. They do not follow market forces and can be meaningful and well done (e.g. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation).\n\n\nFor profit startups are all about making money and sustaining their impact over time through growing profitability. They do follow market forces and when combined with the right doing good mission can do as much good as it does well.\n\n\nNoosheen encourages listeners to find their Ikigai which may be in a non-profit or for-profit, big or small, well-funded or not. Each person has their own journey and should identify what brings them happiness.\n\n\n[ 44:45 ] Doing Good through non-profits is incredibly useful and has HUGE impacts. That said, there is a rising tide of for profits that are Doing Good AND Doing Well\n\n\nFor Noosheen, January AI is her foray into building a sustaining Doing Well by Doing Good business that could solve a very difficult problem with a widespread impact.\n\n\nDoing Well by Doing Good is extremely hard in healthcare because it is incredibly opaque. This complexity is what attracted Noosheen to tackling chronic conditions ‚Äî one of the most difficult healthcare challenges\n\n\nAdvice for Listeners\n[ 47:15 ] Figure out truly what you are good at, what puts you in flow. That requires being honest with yourself.\n\n\nLean into your strengths so you can force multiply your impact and make them into a superpower. This is the fastest way to maximize impact.\n\n\nEvery person is different. It‚Äôs good to have role models but discovering yourself it most important in your career.\n\n\n[ 49:03 ] For entrepreneurs, what is your WHY? Keep asking why until you get to the bottom of it because entrepreneurship is a VERY difficult journey.\n\n\nOvernight success takes 15 years, nothing comes easy.\n\n\nEvery journey looks different, you can‚Äôt find your WHY anywhere else\n\n\n\nThanks for listening and reading!

Her deep experience in finance informs her investment thesis in building financial rails for the underbanked in emerging markets.\n\nIn this episode, we talk through her journey to becoming an impact investor at Flourish and how it expanded from the initial remit of the Omidyar Network (started by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar ), the companies she invests in, the balance between Doing Good and Doing Well and debate the merits of promoting shareholder value while still maintaining the original mission and the inherent tension in that journey.\nThanks for reading Doing Well By Doing Good!

Enjoy!\n\nHow it all started\n[ 1:00 ] Journey to Flourish Ventures\n\n\nAnuradha started in traditional finance, got into venture capital through a friend‚Äôs introduction and never looked back.\n\n\nAnuradha led the India practice in Omidyar Network but the number of investments was too large so they split up the practice and Flourish Ventures was created to focus on emerging markets (South &amp; Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa)\n\n\n[ 4:30 ] Thesis at Flourish Ventures\n\n\nFocus on sectoral change by changing the way people interact with the financial system.\n\n\nExample s: financial rails companies such as Plaid - **UPI ‚Äî **open source protocol for financial transactions created by the Indian Government, ZestMoney ‚Äî consumer facing app to provide users liquidity\n\n\n[ 8:52 ] Anuradha‚Äôs thoughts on UPI in India as a way to jumpstart the financial system and innovation\n\n\nUPI is an open system but is public infrastructure and thus makes it harder for private players built on it to charge a large fee.\n\n\nTransaction and convenience fees are most common in OTAs (online travel agencies) but hard to initiate for all financial transactions.\n\n\nUPI has started to connect with credit cards which may bring down the cost of credit card fees due to its open nature, thus opening up more liquidity for the underbanked and jumpstarting the Indian market.\n\n\nMission\n[ 14:35 ] Uniqueness of Flourish‚Äôs mission\n\n\nFocused on the companies building financial rails and being patient in these investments understanding they can have long-term adoption curves (&gt; 5-10 years)\n\n\nInvestment Examples : Swap, M2P, Brick, Flutterwave are examples of Plaid-like businesses in Latin American, South / Southeast Asian and African markets respectively.\n\n\nDoing Well &amp; Doing Good\n[ 16:35 ] How do you maintain the balance between doing well and doing good as the company grows?\n\n\nInvest in businesses first and foremost (rather than ideas) that have solid unit economics and an opportunity to monetize (e.g. ‚Äúbig data small credit‚Äù).\n\n\nBack founders through at least 2 rounds of funding and back the winners (defined by both impact and financial metrics).\n\n\nTough love is important for startups to emphasize focusing on unit economics and pushing founders to not lose sight of it in lieu of the mission.\n\n\n[ 22:40 ] Are there differences between metrics of doing well and doing good?\n\n\nWe first look at impact ‚Äî is this ‚Äúdemocratizing finance‚Äù and will it affect the lives of low income and vulnerable populations OR is it increasing transparency and financial participation across all income levels?\n\n\nFinancial metrics are paramount for emerging markets because there aren‚Äôt as many mature buyers for companies ‚Äî so those are independent of impact and are always considered with impact metrics.\n\n\n[ 25:45 ] When adoption is the key metric how do you determine how sticky a product or service is?\n\n\nMonitoring and quantifying user behavior and repeat usage on the platform\n\n\nWhat is the participation of the ecosystem (e.g. lenders and borrowers)? What is the proportion between these two and how can this be sustained?\n\n\nDoing Good &amp; Impact\n[ 29:00 ] How do portfolio companies deal with conflicts between mission and doing well? (e.g. profitability via serving the ultra-rich vs. serving the underserved populations)\n\n\nConflicts occur when the product does not serve underserved populations (e.g. 90% of folks are not salaried in the emerging markets so providing means a neo-bank for the underbanked must provide ramps on and off of saving)\n\n\nGoal of the fund is to ensure portfolio companies serve a wide range of users across the economic spectrum (rather than just the underserved) and thus prevent this conflict. Companies can use the ultra-rich to fund the service to the underbanked thus meeting financial metrics while also distributing the benefit equitably.\n\n\n[ 34:00 ] How to sustain doing good over multiple rounds of funding and growth?\n\n_ Doing good is not separate from doing business_ in the emerging market because even the high net worth individuals are underbanked and need access to liquidity. This concept was also the core of eBay (the exit which funded the initial Omidyar Network fund). The opportunity to bring the whole socioeconomic ladder up in the emerging markets is HUGE.\n\n[ 38:45 ] Example : Affordplan enables individuals to absorb large healthcare costs and plan for their financial future.

As always, if you‚Äôre interested in the whole episode peruse the Spotify preview below, or cruise over to the bullet points below for specific points of the conversation and the TLDR; Enjoy!\n\nBackground and Journey\n[1:15] What was your journey and how did you get into impact investing?\n\n\nWorked in genetic labs in undergrad and met the Counsyl (acq. by Myriad Genetics in 2018) team 14 years ago which lead to the first investment.\n\n\nFuture Communities Capital came out of this desire to invest in healthtech, biotech and finding opportunities for large-scale change (e.g. Counsyl‚Äôs vision was to eliminate inherited diseases)\n\n\nUnique differentiator - focused on mission-driven companies primarily but not exclusively in healthcare and committed to delivering value via high-value intros to accelerate sales (e.g. a novel healthtech looking to sell to health systems)\n\n\nPortfolio Companies - Growth and Mission\n[ 8:45[] How do your portfolio companies sustain growth and evolve business models? ](open.spotify.com/episode/1tu6ESK9pC7Wo0naAj1YMn%3Ashow%3A4ZpKwhV1xihtsJzcOeKu9R)\n\nExample : Akido Labs started as a platform to make ineffectual unstructured healthcare data valuable. FCC introduced them to customers to accelerate growth. They doubled down on their vulnerable patient population and decided to become a complete care delivery platform for that vertical.\n\n[ 13:01[] How do you ensure multiple stakeholders are on the same page as the company](open.spotify.com/episode/1tu6ESK9pC7Wo0naAj1YMn%3Ashow%3A4ZpKwhV1xihtsJzcOeKu9R) grows and shifts directions to maintain the mission?\n\nGrowth and making money solves all problems, but a strong mission-driven company culture that perpetuates through growth can ensure stakeholders are on board throughout.\n\n[ 15:40[] How do you determine stickiness of the product or service of a potential portfolio company and how assess the metrics at the early stage?](open.spotify.com/episode/1tu6ESK9pC7Wo0naAj1YMn%3Ashow%3A4ZpKwhV1xihtsJzcOeKu9R)\n\n\nKey is to identify that the founder knows the industry they are selling to, have built trusted relationships with customers and are able and willing to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty.\n\n\nExample : Znest facilitates finding the right senior community living by making pricing more transparent. The founder is an expert in real estate and can call on REIT owners to put their senior housing facilities on the platform.\n\n\nMeasuring Doing Well and Doing Good\n[ 19:45[] How do you measure doing well and doing good? ](open.spotify.com/episode/1tu6ESK9pC7Wo0naAj1YMn%3Ashow%3A4ZpKwhV1xihtsJzcOeKu9R)\n\n\nPrior to Series B / A, the metrics are often off anyways so it‚Äôs best to look at the model rather than the absolute numbers.\n\n\nGoal setting and plan-making is more important than the absolute numbers at the early stage.\n\n\n[ 21:50[] Conflicts between Doing Well and Doing Good ](open.spotify.com/episode/1tu6ESK9pC7Wo0naAj1YMn%3Ashow%3A4ZpKwhV1xihtsJzcOeKu9R&amp;t=1308)\n\n\nPublic companies have a much harder time than private companies because public markets provide more scrutiny than private companies\n\n\nPrivate companies face challenges only when the board doesn‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with the founders. Board formation is critical at the early stage for that reason.\n\n\nBuilding trust with vulnerable customers is hard to build and conflicts with the mission could hamper that.

Unfortunately, not all of these applications have been for good (e.g. military drones, unfair insurance practices, etc.). January AI, like other DWDG companies decided they would take another path and help those most vulnerable ‚Äî those with chronic conditions‚Äî while building a business.\n\nBut solving the $36T problem of chronic conditions in the US takes more than just a bit of software magic. 60% of Americans live with at least 1 chronic condition, 42% with 2 or more and 5% with 3 or more. While there‚Äôs no silver bullet for chronic conditions, a large part of treatment is changing behaviors. January AI uses AI-driven continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to help with cognitive behavior therapy ‚Äî or a human-in-the-loop system to help users change their behaviors.\nNoosheen talked a bit about the AI-driven bit in our first conversation (see below), but recently January AI decided to expand the software and hardware components of their CGM and expand into chemistry.\n[\nüéôÔ∏è Noosheen Hashemi - CEO of January AI, Seasoned Tech Leader and Philanthropist\nAnand¬∑April 8, 2022Read full story](dwdg.substack.com/p/-noosheen-hashemi-ceo-of-january)\n\nEden‚Äôs is all-natural probiotic that improves gut health and complements the AI-powered CGM by improving cardiac, metabolic and immune system performance.\n\nBelow we highlight the key points and link parts of the episode where you can learn more. Enjoy!!!\nMission and Goals\n\n\n[ 0:45 ] Mission: Grow the world‚Äôs health span. Health span is not just about long life but how you feel during that long life. Today January AI is focused on the US where healthcare costs are ~10-100x more expensive than other countries but hopes to prove the model and expand.\n\n\n[ 5:19 ] AI predicts sugar levels hours into the future using CGM and activity signals and adjusts by suggesting different dietary choices via notifications.\n\n\n[ 12:04 ] Diet is core to managing blood sugar. Eden‚Äôs is an all-natural prebiotic that January AI has been researching for 3 years to balance sugar levels and improve metabolic, cardio and immune health.\n\n\nDoing Good\n\n\n[ 16:35 ] Enabling Health Equity: January AI has extensive data relating dietary choices to blood sugar and activity levels across different user cohorts and uses this digital twin data to advocate to big food manufacturers (e.g. Pepsi, Nestle, etc) and governments to invest in improving access to healthy food.\n\n\n[ 24:31 ] Changing Food Habits requires years of training, but January AI‚Äôs CGM tool and regular use of Eden‚Äôs can facilitate the process in the moment both in-silico (via the app) as well as in-vivo (via the probiotic drink).\n\n\n[ 26:49 ] Mechanism for Eden‚Äôs and supplement vs. drugs ‚Äî produces short chain fatty acids which increase secretion of GLP1 and PYY hormones which reduce your appetite, increases sateity and increases secretion of insulin to bring up glucose levels. Focus on the first principles rather than drugs like Metformin.\n\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\n[ 33:16 ] We are a pill culture today - January AI is changing that by focusing on step-by-step changes that slowly move you to your goal naturally and safely. Reinforces good habits rather than bad ones. Noosheen share‚Äôs her own experience being a startup founder, struggling to maintain good habits and using January AI.\n\nDoing Well\n\n[ 41:10 ] Eden‚Äôs went on sale in November, has high ratings, NPS scores. v2 of the January app released to beta in early 2023.

We started with our voices, and slowly built other means to create music from drums, stringed-instruments the world over like the sitar, veena, erhu, shamisen, and eventually complex instruments like harpsichords, pianos and harmoniums.\n\nBut there were just the beginning, in the last 150 years since the advent of electricity, using electronic instruments have been the in-thing. Most of our music enjoy the benefits of this technological explosion. Of course that doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt enjoy a fancy pianoforte (if the interstellar theme is any indication below) - but even those are often mastered to make them sound perfect (no acoustical blips)\nThanks for reading Muse-ical AI ! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\nSubscribe\nMost of the music we listen to is synthesized in DAWs (digital audio workstations) and mastered to make them sound perfect to our ears. As a human species with computational tools we have mastered the ability to craft exactly the waveform we want. Yet we still don‚Äôt have a perfect objective for consonance and dissonance.\nSo when it comes to creating music from scratch often we still start with the same fundamentals - chords, melodies and samples. These samples can come from other musicians we jam with, or songs we listen to everyday. Chords and melodies have some fundamentals in Eastern and Western classical music, we generally can use chord progressions we know are consonant.\nOnce we have these basic components we can put any filter on these and modulate these waveforms however we want\n\nNow, where does that leave us with AI ‚Äî well, AI is definitely a different beast. The mathematical cascade of functions that make up Transformers or any deep learning model, initially was meant to emulate the neurons in our brain, but has created a whole new mechanism for creating music.\nNeural networks imitate humans very well but do not think like them ‚Äî let‚Äôs try a text-to-image decoder, text-to-speech decoder and text-to-music decoder to demonstrate with a simple prompt: ‚Äúa calming beach scene with waves crashing against the shore‚Äù.\na calming beach scene with waves crashing against the shore\n1√ó\n0:00\n-0:05\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

Please upgrade.\n‚Äòa calming beach scene with waves crashing against the shore‚Äô as interpreted by a decoder.\nWell, it‚Äôs not too bad, many of the text and language encoders have a deep understanding of these concepts like ‚Äúcalming, beach, etc‚Äù and these concepts are quite common in the unsupervised pre-training data of these encoders. And since each of these models use a variation of those, it‚Äôs not surprising to see it doing a good job. Of the 3 however, music is the one that seems to not quite match what I was looking for. It is chill and repetitive with a rhythm and beat like music should be, but it doesn‚Äôt have that organic wave crashing sound I was looking for.\nIt‚Äôs safe to say to Music as a medium is more complex and nuanced and language is not often the means by which we describe it. That is, data that describes music in detail is not as widespread, so while language encodings are helpful, mapping them to sequential outputs in a spectrogram is not as straightforward.\n\nMusicians create music by ‚Äújamming‚Äù with each other ‚Äî going back and forth with different musical samples with language as a guide to direct attention rather than fully describe a piece of music.\n\nSo‚Ä¶with this in mind, how can we leverage the latest in generative AI? Well, first we should try a small project to test out whether it can generate useful music. I‚Äôll start with creating some Lofi Bollywood Music since I enjoy it and will explore how generative models can help me in the process. I have no idea where this will take me‚Ä¶.but I hope eventually we can develop representations that enable musicians to ‚Äújam‚Äù with AI in a productive way to expand possibilities and create ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (as defined by humans) music.\n\nTo be continued‚Ä¶..\nThanks for reading Muse-ical AI !

The core idea behind MusicGen (vs. previous generators) is that it added text and melody conditioning.\n\n\nThe original model was trained on 20k hours across all genres, but I‚Äôm doubtful lofi bollywood played a role (see the Original Model link below). The original 300M param model did a great job creating indian instrumentals like the sitar and tabla but did not create a lofi vibe. In order to help this model along, I decided finetuning could help and so collected my own dataset w/ 20.8 hours (1/1000x of the original), and finetuned the 300M param model (due to limited GPU compute) however I did see a noticeable improvement when prompting the original and finetuned 300M param (limited GPU compute) MusicGen model with ‚Äúindian lofi beat with eastern instrumentals‚Äù in terms outputting a lofi vibe.\nOriginal Model (AI) :voca.ro/1dRCve3mCCg1\n1√ó\n0:00\n-0:20\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

Please upgrade.\nThe human ear is the best discriminator for consonance vs. dissonance and well‚Ä¶the music continuation wasn‚Äôt great without text prompting and even then it was interesting but quality could still be improved.\n\nMusicGen was helpful in seeding an initial musical idea and extending an idea and transitioning to a new beat and ending a song (albeit not my initial intention). However, the work needed to obtain this was not worth the effort for most musicians, so a few things could be improved\n\n\nReducing friction is key to making this a viable sample generator during the creative process\n\n\n_ For longer form generation, stringing outputs together is likely the most computationally viable way to make generative AI a useful tool_\n\n\n_ Audio quality is still not great from many of these outputs, but for production level audio a sound engineering pipeline will need to accompany these outputs_\n\n\n\nThis was a very simple experiment, but musicians rarely use language to describe music in the development process ‚Äî instead we ‚Äújam‚Äù with other musicians going back-and-forth with samples. Given all of this I have some ideas for where to go from here.\nNext Steps\n\n\nShare code and notebooks from this experiment to see what others get\n\n\nTest other transformer-based music encoder-decoder architectures (e.g. MusicLM) and diffusion models (Riffusion)\n\n\nExtend the lofi dataset and acquire more GPU resources to train deeper models.\n\n\nString together models to create an organic ‚Äújam‚Äù session and longer samples (especially using language as an intermediate representation)\n\n\nI have no idea where this is going, but I‚Äôm excited to see where it takes me and if nothing else, I‚Äôll hopefully create my own ‚Äújam buddy‚Äù to expand my creative process.\nReferences and Credits:\n\n\nMusicGen HF: huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen\n\n\nMusicGen Github: github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft\n\n\nMusicGen Trainer (c/o neverix): github.com/neverix/musicgen_trainer/tree/main\n\n\n\nStay tuned for more‚Ä¶\n‚úåüèΩ\nThanks for reading Muse-ical AI !

We realized that the guests on our show still embody that ethos of Doing Well and Doing Good - i.e. Profitability with a Purpose. However, one missing piece in our exploration has been the technical risks that could be perceived as not ‚ÄúDoing Good‚Äù. Business dictates profitability - i.e. Doing Well, but Doing Good has been defined as helping those that are most vulnerable via a product or service, without consideration of technological risks that also can come with certain technologies ‚Äî i.e. a financial product that collects personal information to provide a way for people to access capital who otherwise couldn‚Äôt, can certainly be perceived as good, but not considering the risks of holding personal information which could leak or bias downstream Machine Learning models does us a disservice.\nIn this new rebrand we hope to bridge this gap.\nWhy AI and not another Technology?\nApart from AI being in the news, there are real considerations of this technology that we otherwise might not have thought about - data leakage, bias, security and detrimental use cases (i.e. misinformation or hallucination) which are critical to the mission of doing good - especially as the companies inevitably grow their influence.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Podcast?\nWe‚Äôll keep highlighting leaders of companies that are Doing Well by Doing Good and exploring the business and mission aspects, but will make a few changes:\n\n\nFocus on AI companies : that is, companies leveraging Machine Learning in production who have insight into downstream implications of these technologies.\n\n\nHighlight technical leaders : CTOs, Directors of Engineering, Heads of ML, AI Researchers and others who have foresight into what risks may come in the future and how to mitigate them in addition to continuing to talk to founders and investors, technical and non-technical.

It enabled drums, pianos, synths and everything in between to be represented in a standard discretized format, which made digital instruments possible. Of course since then there has been lots of work trying to convert MIDI instruments to sound like real sounds to simplify recording. MIDI enabled a number of use cases at that time:\n\n\nmusicians can create melodies and drums without having to record in a studio (quiet atmosphere and perfect sound isolation) since you can posthoc process sounds to match the pitch.\n\n\ndifferent instruments can interact - you can create a melody in one instrument (even a computer keyboard) and modify it on another\n\n\nsimplified and democratized music production by enabling a common language, expanding the range of possible sounds for music producers and expanding the reach of music production capabilities.\n\n\n\nFollow Along in the Google Colab\nThis post is pretty long‚Ä¶but the hope is that after this you will have learned the following:\n\n\nWhat is a MIDI file and how to manipulate it in python at a basic level?\n\n\nWhat are some of seminal MIDI Generation papers and what MIDI representations do they use for training / inference?\n\n\nHow to convert MIDI files to these various formats for use in these models?\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre only interested in some of the above, jump to the section below and click on the Google Colab link to take you directly to that section in the notebook. All of our notebooks and code for this blog are also on Github\nEnjoy!\nMIDI Basics\nTurns out that MIDI‚Äôs discrete nature also makes it much easier to represent as a matrix and to leverage in machine learning models to predict the next sequence. MIDI is used in every Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) as Ableton, Garageband, Logic Pro, etc. for music production, and so musicians are also very familiar with working with these tools. Let‚Äôs first take a look at what a MIDI file is‚Ä¶\nAbleton DAW w/ multiple midi tracks\nMIDI files consist of a bunch of messages in sequential order, and can represent 128 different pitches at various intervals, durations and velocities. The files themselves are in byte-encodings so reading them in a text editor doesn‚Äôt yield much, but python libraries like mido provide a simple way to parse these messages. Since it‚Äôs not required for our exploration, the interested reader can read about byte-encodings here.\n\nQuick Side Note : throughout this post I use 3 key python libraries for working with MIDI files each with their own pros/cons. You can find more details here: mido (link), pretty_midi (link), pypianoroll (link)\n\nExample Track (‚ÄúRoja‚Äù by A.R. Rahman)\nWe use a simple melody from the TheoryTab dataset, which has both melody and chords for thousands of songs. We downloaded the melody for ‚ÄúRoja‚Äù which looks something like this:\n\nYou can also visualize these in standard musical notation using a tool like MuseScore\nMuseScore rendition of the midi file\nIn true MIDI form, we assign any instrument we want to this to create a sound from the MIDI file. Here are a few examples:\nPiano\n1√ó\n0:00\n-0:45\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.\n_ Mandolin_\n1√ó\n0:00\n-0:45\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.\n_ String-Ensemble Synth (Audio Recording - has some ambient noise)_\n1√ó\n0:00\n-0:48\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.\nExploring MIDI File Structure\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nA MIDI file is a combo of messages which look something like below. We use mido to parse and print out the messages via python. More details in the Colab, but here‚Äôs a quick preview. Put simply, there are meta messages and musical messages, where meta messages set things like time signature, key signature, tempo, etc. while musical messages specify specific the pitch, velocity and duration of notes to be played. MIDI files keep time using ‚Äúticks‚Äù which, based on tempo, time signature and BPM can be converted into seconds.\nMidiFile(type=1, ticks_per_beat=480, tracks=[\n  MidiTrack([\n    MetaMessage(&#039;set_tempo&#039;, tempo=631579, time=0),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;time_signature&#039;, numerator=4, denominator=4, clocks_per_click=24, notated_32nd_notes_per_beat=8, time=0),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;key_signature&#039;, key=&#039;E&#039;, time=0),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;marker&#039;, text=&#039;4_4_m_5_&#039;, time=0),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;marker&#039;, text=&#039;11_11__5_&#039;, time=960),\n    ...\n    MetaMessage(&#039;marker&#039;, text=&#039;4_4__5_&#039;, time=960),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;marker&#039;, text=&#039;9_9__5_&#039;, time=960),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;marker&#039;, text=&#039;11_11__5_&#039;, time=960),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;end_of_track&#039;, time=1)]),\n]),\n  MidiTrack([\n    MetaMessage(&#039;track_name&#039;, name=&#039;melody&#039;, time=0),\n    Message(&#039;program_change&#039;, channel=0, program=0, time=0),\n    Message(&#039;note_on&#039;, channel=0, note=64, velocity=80, time=0),\n    Message(&#039;note_on&#039;, channel=0, note=64, velocity=0, time=480),\n    Message(&#039;note_on&#039;, channel=0, note=67, velocity=80, time=0),\n    ...\n    Message(&#039;note_on&#039;, channel=0, note=67, velocity=0, time=0),\n    Message(&#039;note_on&#039;, channel=0, note=66, velocity=0, time=480),\n    MetaMessage(&#039;end_of_track&#039;, time=1)])\n])\n\nIn this section of the Colab we go message-by-message and interpret them to gain an appreciation for the way these files work (and perhaps a motivation for why certain representations are used in MIDI generation models).\nMIDI Generation Models - Through the Years\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nIf we look at some of the core papers looking at MIDI generation there have been a number in the past few years - I won‚Äôt try to be completely comprehensive here but I will note some of the important ones. The most notable ones in ~chronological order are (and coincidently, though unsurprisingly, grouped by models which correspond to the most popular types of models at the time):\n_ RNN-Based_\n\nMelodyRNN (Jul 2016) [Paper,Code, Website]: LSTM based model for MIDI inputs\n\n* Derivatives: DrumsRNN, ImprovRNN, PerformanceRNN, MusicRNN\n\n\nDeepBach (Dec 2016) [Paper, Code, Website]: a Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation\n\n_ GAN-Based_\n\n\nMidiNet (Mar 2017) [Paper, Code, Website]: Convolutional GAN-based sequential prediction of MIDI nodes with conditioning options for chord sequences and melody of previous bars\n\n\nMuseGAN (~2017) [Papers, Code, Website]: GAN-based model for generating multi-track MIDI files\n\n\n_ VAE-Based_\n\nMusicVAE (Mar 2018) [Paper, Code, Website]: Interpolate between two 16 bar midi notes for smoothness, realism and expression\n\n* Derivatives: GrooVAE\n\n_ Transformer-Based_\n\n\nMusic Transformer (Dec 2018) [Paper, Code, Website]: Transformer-based model for generating multi-track MIDI files\n\n\nMuseNet (~2019) [Paper, Code,Website]: GPT-2 based model for generating multi-track MIDI files\n\n\nMost importantly, they all use some form of a sequence as an input for training and inference. What we‚Äôll focus on first, is the question: what format do these models expect the input to be in?\nNOTE: We are explicitly ignoring the question of preprocessing datasets (i.e. what format do datasets come in and how to transform them), which we will defer to the next post since it is important for training these sequence models above or creating our own to craft a training set which may include multiple sources that need to be standardized to a single input format. For now, we assume we have a MIDI file present as above and convert them to a format usable for training. We will also defer augmentation and other adjustments (e.g. transposition, tempo adjustments, etc.) to the next post where we‚Äôll discuss considerations for training the models.\nBinary Piano Roll Representations\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nThe piano roll representation is a common way to represent music data. It consists of a two-dimensional matrix where the rows represent time steps and the columns represent pitches (and special symbols in certain variations). The entries of the matrix are often non-negative.\nOne example is when the entries are binary, indicating whether a note is played at a given time step and pitch.\nX ‚àà {0, 1}^(h√ów) where h is the number of pitches and w is the number of time steps.\nNOTE: velocity and complex time signature differences are IGNORED in this version!\n binary pianoroll representation\nAnother variation on this form also considers the velocity of the note. In this case, the entries are integers in the range of 0-127 indicating the velocity of the note played at a given time step and pitch. In this first section, we will talk about the models that look at only the binary piano roll representation, but will revisit the velocity in the next section.\nX ‚àà [0,127]^(h√ów)\nNOTE: The number of pitches in a MIDI file is 128, however the dimension ofh may be reduced to narrow the range of notes to a specific instrument (e.g. 88 keys in a piano) or can be expanded to include silence or rests (e.g. 129/130 or 89/90). The time steps also depend on the model and level of granularity desired. For coherence, many models filter inputs to 4/4 time signatures and use sixteenth notes as a single time step (16 steps / bar).\nFor the RNN-Based, GAN-Based and VAE-Based models above, at some level all of these look at splitting the MIDI files into discrete time bars and ignoring the velocity. However they vary in how they split the bars and the granularity of notes they use.\n_ RNN-Based_\n\n\nMelodyRNN : ‚Äú[60, -2, 60, -2, 67, -2, 67, -2]‚Äù (-2 = no event, -1=note-off event, 0-127 = note-on event for that MIDI pitch) for each track. 4/4 time signature with 16th notes as a single time step. Each bar has 16 time steps. Samples can be 2 bars or 16 bars.\n\n\nDeepBach : 4 tracks/rows (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) with 16 time steps per bar (16th notes) represented by strings for the 128 pitches C1 to G9 and a hold __ (i.e. 129 total pitches), two additional rows are added with 0 or 1 to indicate fermata and the beat count (e.g. 1,2,3,4)\n\n\n_ GAN-Based_\n\n\nMidiNet : piano roll representation in 4/4 time signature with 16th notes as a single time step. Each track is a new channel (e.g. CxHxW). Each sample is 1 bar and each value can be one of 128 MIDI pitches or silence resulting in a Cx129x16 matrix for each bar.\n\n\nMuseGAN : piano roll representation in 4/4 time signature with 16th notes as 6 time steps. That is each bar has 96 time steps. Each track is a new channel and each sample is 1 bar (e.g. CxHxW). Each value can be one of 128 MIDI pitches resulting in Cx128x96 matrix for each bar. The dimensions are rearranged to be 96x128xC.\n\n\n_ VAE-Based_\n\nMusicVAE : ‚Äú[60, -2, 60, -2, 67, -2, 67, -2]‚Äù (-2 = no event, -1=note-off event, 0-127 = note-on event for that MIDI pitch) for each track. 4/4 time signature with 16th notes as a single time step. Each bar has 16 time steps. Samples can be 2 bars or 16 bars.\n\nObservations:\n\n\nAll of these models use 4/4 time signature and a 16th note or some subset of them as a time step. This is likely because it helps with standardization and structure of the data. For examples if we processed 6/8 or 5/4 time signatures and split them with the same time steps as 4/4, we would capture motifs that span bars which may not be consistent. And since the majority of pieces are 4/4, it is advantageous to use that time signature and discard others.\n\n\nAll representations discard the velocity of the notes. This is likely because it is not as important for the melody and the models then not as sensitive to it, that is, there is less to learn. Velocity variations could also be added posthoc to make the outputs seem more realistic.\n\n\nRepresentations of the matrix are still highly variable and depends on the model, the DL library (TF, Pytorch, etc) and the application. We‚Äôll next explore code to transform MIDI files to these formats. For the above models we‚Äôll focus on the following 3 common formats which were most common:\n\n\nCompressed Piano Roll Representation w/ Pitch Indices (CxW): MelodyRNN, MusicVAE\n\n\nCompressed Piano Roll Representation w/ Note Names (CxW): DeepBach\n\n\nOne/Multi-Hot Piano Roll Representations (CxHxW): MidiNet, MuseGAN\n\n\n\n\n1. Compressed Piano Roll Representation w/ Pitch Indices (CxW)\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nThese representations are used commonly by the Google Magenta team across MelodyRNN and MusicVAE and represent each time step with an absolute pitch index 0-127 rather than a 1-hot or multi-hot encoding. Since it is can only represent 1 note per time step, the channels or C dimension enable multiple instruments or notes to be represented. We ignored the -1 note-off event and defaulted to -2 for no event for time steps where the note is not playing.\n\n2. Compressed Piano Roll Representation w/ Note Names (CxW)\nGoogle Colab Link to Section \nHere we use a very similar approach to above, but convert the notes and like it is described in DeepBach, we use the __ symbol for a hold where there are no notes playing.\n\n3. One/Multi-Hot Piano Roll Representations (CxHxW)\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nThe one/multi-hot piano roll representation is the classic representation used by MidiNet and MuseGAN and ignore the velocity which means that the piano roll representation they adhere too is the binary one: X ‚àà {0, 1}^(H√óW) as shown above in the binary piano roll format.\nHere the output of the piano roll will be a matrix with 128 rows (H) to signify the 128 different pitch levels (note a piano only has 88). The columns (W) will be the time steps. The values will be 1 or 0 to signify whether the note is played or not as a one-hot encoding.\nWe can define a simple function to convert a MIDI file to this simple format. We‚Äôll use the pretty_midi library to parse the MIDI file and then use the pypianoroll library to convert it to a piano roll representation.\n\nExpressive Piano Roll &amp; Language-Based Representations\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nFollowing in the footsteps of recent language models, transformer based models can use more expressive piano roll and language-based encodings to represent the MIDI files. In particular, language modeling has often used byte-pair encodings (BPE) to represent words as a sequence of bytes. This is a great way to represent words because it allows for a variable length encoding of words and allows for the model to learn sub-word representations.\nLet‚Äôs explore what the Transformer based models use to represent MIDI files.\n_ Transformer-Based_\n\nMusic Transformer (Google) : Multiple formats for different datasets and experiments\n\n* JS Chorales Bach: (similar to DeepBach) uses the following sequence of 4 voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) in 4/4 time in sixteenth note increments\n\n\n  * Inputs are serialized $S_1A_1T_1B_1S_2A_2T_2B_2$ and each token is represented as a one-hot vector ‚Üí 128 x (WxC) where W is number of sixteenth notes and C is the number of channels - in this case 4 for each voice\n\n* Piano E Competition Dataset: [Ref: [arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03715.pdf]](colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1808.03715.pdf%255D) ‚Üí Use a set of sequence events like the following.\n\n\n  * Overall the total number of sequences are eventually represented as a sequence of 1-hot vectors representing each of the 388 possible events -&gt; 388 x T where T is the the number of 10ms increments in the sample. This representation for the Piano competition dataset is discussed in section 6.1 of [this paper](colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00521-018-3758-9).\n\n    * 128 `NOTE-ON` events: one for each of the 128 MIDI pitches. Each one starts a new note.\n\n    * 128 `NOTE-OFF` events: one for each of the 128 MIDI pitches. Each one releases a note.\n\n    * 100 `TIME-SHIFT` events: each one moves the time step forward by increments of 10 ms up to 1 s.\n\n    * 32 `VELOCITY` events: each one changes the velocity applied to all subsequent notes (until the next velocity event).\n\n\nMuseNet (OpenAI) : bach piano_strings start tempo90 piano:v72:G1 piano:v72:G2 piano:v72:B4 piano:v72:D4 violin:v80:G4 piano:v72:G4 piano:v72:B5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:B5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:4 piano:v0:G1 piano:v0:G2 piano:v0:B4 piano:v0:D4 violin:v0:G4 piano:v0:G4 wait:1 piano:v72:G5 wait:12 piano:v0:G5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:5 piano:v72:B5 wait:12\n\nObservations:\n\n\nTransformer-based model representations are more flexible and leverage expressivity (velocity) and polyphonicity.\n\n\nTransformer-based model representations only require sequential processing but are open to using one-hot vectors (i.e. pianoroll representations) as well as language based ones (i.e. MuseNet).\n\n\nRepresentations can be broken down in the following ways:\n\n\nOne-hot Binary Piano Roll Representations (128x(WxC)): Music Transformer (JS Chorales Bach)\n\n\nOne-hot Expressive Piano Roll Representations (388xW): Music Transformer (Piano E Competition)\n\n\nSequential Encoding &amp; Tokenization (???): MuseNet\n\n\n\n\n1. One-hot Binary Piano Roll Representations (128x(WxC))\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nThis is not too dissimilar from our previous work on representations except that it allows for combining the channels from different instruments into 1 dimension which means that W (the time dimension) and C (the channel dimension) are combined. It also means that an encoder and decoder must be present to identify these differences. Given we only have 1 track, the output will not be any different for our trial MIDI file, however we define a function that would work for multiple tracks. Our second dimension is WxC (in our case 1680x1=1680)\n\n2. One-hot Expressive Representation (388xW) - 1 Track\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nThis is a unique approach because it takes into account timing and velocity. It is also a one-hot representation, but it is not a piano roll representation. Instead it is a sequence of events that are encoded as one-hot vectors. To recap, the events we care about are:\n\n\n128 NOTE-ON events: one for each of the 128 MIDI pitches. Each one starts a new note.\n\n\n128 NOTE-OFF events: one for each of the 128 MIDI pitches. Each one releases a note. NOTE-ON with velocity 0 is equivalent to NOTE-OFF.\n\n\n100 TIME-SHIFT events: each one moves the time step forward by increments of 10 ms up to 1 s.\n\n\n32 VELOCITY events: each one changes the velocity applied to all subsequent notes (until the next velocity event).\n\n\nOur MIDI file is fairly standard in that it has just 1 velocity across all monophonic notes. Therefore, we will see very standard representations for this. However, if we had a more expressive MIDI file with multiple instruments and velocities, we would see more VELOCITY events. You might have noticed that we could add more events here to the vocabulary to expand the 1-hot representation to include other musical events like TEMPO or KEY_SIGNATURE or TIME_SIGNATURE or PROGRAM_CHANGE or CONTROL_CHANGE (e.g. pedal, levers,etc.) or PITCH_WHEEL, etc. However, we‚Äôll leave that for a future post. These are the events used in Musical Transformer.\n\n3. Sequential Encoding &amp; Tokenization (???)\nGoogle Colab Link to Section\nWhile MuseNet was one of the most interesting applications of MIDI-based music generation using GPT-2 and Sparse Transformers, the blog post was ‚Äúsparse‚Äù in its explanation of the encoding. Since the tokens were not explained I am not entirely sure how to convert the language sequence provided to discrete tokens to train a model (e.g. byte-pair encoding). We‚Äôll use some combination of expressive representations in 2 and 3 to train our own transformer-based model in a future post.\nFor now, we‚Äôll write some code to convert a MIDI file to a format similar to the one mentioned in their blog post - all timings in ticks and all notes in MIDI pitch values.:\nbach piano_strings start tempo90 piano:v72:G1 piano:v72:G2 piano:v72:B4 piano:v72:D4 violin:v80:G4 piano:v72:G4 piano:v72:B5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:B5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:4 piano:v0:G1 piano:v0:G2 piano:v0:B4 piano:v0:D4 violin:v0:G4 piano:v0:G4 wait:1 piano:v72:G5 wait:12 piano:v0:G5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:5 piano:v72:B5 wait:12\n\nConclusions\nMIDI data is definitely here to stay! In the last 40 years it has gone from creating robotic like synthetic sounds, so the basis of all modern compositions (i.e. it would be hard to find any music producer today who doesn‚Äôt use MIDI for at least some tracks and layers). If you‚Äôve made it this far, üëèüèΩ CONGRATS! üéâ By now, you should be able to answer these questions.\n\n\nWhat is a MIDI file and how to manipulate it in python at a basic level?\n\n\nWhat are some of seminal MIDI Generation papers and what MIDI representations do they use for training / inference?\n\n\nHow to convert MIDI files to these various formats for use in these models?\n\n\nIn addition, I had a few observations from this post which will hopefully be useful in our following posts.\n\n\nMIDI Outputs Sound Real : MIDI outputs can easily sound crisp when interpreted by Digital Audio Workstations (e.g. Ableton Live, Garageband, etc) because digital instruments have gotten very sophisticated, emulating timbre, bass and even the mechanical sounds of instruments.\n\n\nTransformer Models Represent Long Term Structure Best : MIDI models have been around for a long time, though in the last 5 years they have blown up with progress in sequential models from RNNs, GANs, VAEs and Transformers. The naturally sequential nature of MIDI files has been a perfect match which is shown in the impressive improvement in performance over time, with transformer-based models leading the pack in expressiveness because the sequences leverage velocity, polyphonicity and the dynamics of MIDI instruments. Transformer models have also shown to represent long term structure (unsurprising given similar results in language) on subjective human evaluations, making transformers the leading candidate for future models.\n\n\nMIDI Model Tensor Data Formats are Disparate : MIDI-based Music Generation data models use very different formats where each is nearly bespoke for each model. While many great python tools like pypianoroll , pretty_midi, and mido exist, there isn‚Äôt an easy way to convert back-and-forth between standard MIDI formats and the different formats used for models. We believe this is because the datasets used (i.e. monophonic like our melody, polyphonic classical, polyphonic rock, multi-track, etc) also play a large part in the ways the model developers consider how to represent inputs and how they discretized the time steps.\n\n\nNext Steps\nIn this post, we assume we have 1 MIDI file, but real training datasets can have a diversity of information and parsing and cleaning them, requires further consideration. Given our conclusions, here are a few next steps:\n\n\nExplore building MIDI generation training datasets by parsing and cleaning open source MIDI data as well as creating our own. In the process, develop a simple library to transform between data formats and tensor formats.\n\n\nTrain our own models to create our own compositions by taking a deeper dive into MIDI generation models, esp. transformer models since they are flexible and we can experiment with the latest architectures being used for language modeling. We can also choose to use the same encodings as the models above or we can experiment with other encodings that express similar or even additional information and see how models respond to those additional parameters.\n\n\nThanks for reading Muse-ical AI !

PathAI rode the Deep Learning wave in 2016 to surpass existing diagnosis solutions using SOTA ResNet architectures and won the CAMELYON _2016challenge, _but still had to work to platformize the technology.\n\n\nSelling and delivering value for biopharma customers in their translational research and clinical trials required good relationships and trust with biopharma teams ‚Äî Andy had developed many of the relationships doing research.\n\n\n[4:19] PathAI overcame the initial _cold start _problem of data in their first project by adhering to the lean startup method and partnering with a large biopharma to build and learn iteratively:\n\n\nThis biopharma provided a small set of gigapixel-sized whole slide images after PathAI gave them a discount and promised to deliver AI biomarkers.\n\n\nAnnotations were the real bottleneck on these 100,000x100,000px images. In the early days Andy annotated whole slide images himself!!!\n\n\nToday PathAI can get thousands of annotations in hours with their network of thousands of annotators and collect data from multiple third-party and customer sources.\n\n\nPathAI Business Model\n[8:31] Sell accurate and reproducible analysis of gigapixel images to enable high quality research for improved clinical outcomes and higher quality clinical care.\n\n\nInitial investment in building the foundational ML models might be high but it is amortized over time with the right unit economics.\n\n\nOver time the models improve iteratively, improving the customer experience\n\n\nThis is sustainable because this is a critical need for research and clinical practice and the accuracy, reproducibility and predictive power of the models are tied to the financial success of the business.\n\n\n[11:27] What is the common thread between research and clinical practice?\n\n\nSimilar to foundational models like GPT where predicting the next word is the core, at PathAI, the core unit of analysis is a gigapixel whole slide image of tissue, segmentation of those tissues and classification of cells - this basic functionality underlies all of their products.\n\n\nDownstream human interpretable features can be calculated downstream for research purposes but those same features and embeddings can be used for clinical diagnosis as well.\n\n\nRegulatory oversight may be different between and within clinical trials and clinical practice. PathAI focuses on finding common regulatory requirements and ensuring high adherence to those across both types of deployments.\n\n\nBalancing Shareholder Value and Mission\n[13:49] PathAI is in the business of accurate, reproducible and predictive diagnoses which naturally are tied to improving patient outcomes.\n\n\nImproved diagnostics result in better therapeutics which increase survival rates of patients and are tied to financial success of the business.\n\n\nPathAI has no incentive to falsify or fake results adversarially since that would reduce the likelihood of the customer being able to find an effective drug (and thus the likelihood of them continuing to pay) and so the customer, shareholders and PathAI team are all aligned on patient outcomes.\n\n\n[15:16] PathAI focuses on clinical care where the incentive alignment is clearer than administrative tasks in biopharma like advertising or sales. The stakes are high because the patient is at the center of every interaction and pharma could be risking lives and $100Ms if data didn‚Äôt meet quality standards.\nPathAI Solves the Dearth of Expert Diagnosticians\n[18:05] PathAI enables expert diagnosis at scale through its human-in-the-loop AI making existing pathologists more effective.\n\n\nCurrently PathAI is available in the US but hopes to expand to places where this shortage is more acute.\n\n\nImagine a pre-screen of every patient to enable pathologists to make decisions that surpass even a consensus of pathologists. This future would bring the expertise of multiple pathologists to every patient!\n\n\nWhy For-Profit vs. Non-Profit?\n[21:02] Andy worked for many years in non-profit research organizations such as Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel and found that bringing new ideas to market was a slow burn.\n\n\nFor-profit organizations can raise money from investors looking for a return to quickly iterate, attract talent and deliver results to customers with all stakeholders aligned on the goal.\n\n\nInspired by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon which were all relatively recent tech startups which were privately funded. The model is tried and true.\n\n\n[25:15] The vision for companies is to become self-sustaining so you can reinvest in the company and not rely solely on fundraising as the path to sustainability.\n\nWe switched gears around halfway to talk more about the general healthcare and biotech space, the opportunities and the challenges. We referenced Bessemer Venture Partners 2023 Healthcare and Life Sciences Predictions for some of these topics (highly suggest reading through it if you‚Äôre interested in building in the space :)\nHealthcare and Biotech AI a Net Good?\n[26:40] Companies in the healthcare and biotech spaces fit multiple molds - if they do something bad, the consequences can be much worse given the direct impact to patients:\n\n\nGood : diagnostics or therapeutics companies focused on curing diseases (especially terminal) for patients are nearly always doing something positive.\n\n\nBad : companies providing administrative tasks that are played to further bloat the system vs. reduce costs or improve outcomes (e.g. billing bloat, targeting ads randomly without outcomes in mind, etc)\n\n\nBad : companies who had noble missions but founders or operators did something fraudulent or illegal demonstrating a lack of integrity (e.g. money laundering)\n\n\n[29:30] Outside of patient outcomes, there are many tasks in between that could also be good (e.g. identifying the right tests, increasing efficacy of drugs, etc.) Keeping focused on how the in-between tasks ultimately help patients is helpful to ensure companies don‚Äôt stray from or turn a blind eye to a potential negative effect of their products.\nBallooning Healthcare Costs\n[32:01] Biopharma spends billions on research &amp; development which have paid off for many diseases such as cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, etc. _However , _\n\n\nour current systems incentivizes drug development at the expense of other types of coaching therapy,\n\n\nmore research should be done on changing behaviors since that can also be a cheaper way to achieve similar outcomes and\n\n\npayers and regulators also have a disproportionate say in the pricing of drugs which often drive up the cost.\n\n\n[36:24] How do we get out of this loop?\n\n\nAI tools can help with efficiency and reduce administrative spend.\n\n\nFocusing on critical unmet needs for patients whe developing drugs.\n\n\nLess admin spend can increase the % of dollars spent on understanding disease biology, development of therapies and getting effective therapies approved.\n\n\nGenerative AI Opportunities in Healthcare\n[39:06] PathAI can leverage generative approaches in multiple ways\n\n\nSynthetic data generation of WSI patches with different technical artifacts, image, tissue and stain quality.\n\n\nCommunication of image data, the literature and key results to the patient, treating oncologists, surgeons and folks of all educational and socioeconomic backgrounds. Synthesis, retrieval and summarization of literature, patient history, image information can help make the results of these tests actionable for clinicians and patients.\n\n\n[41:06] Can we use language models to help craft doctor‚Äôs notes or referral notes to specialists?\n\n\nDefinitely, companies like **Open Evidence **are crawling the biomedical literature and summarizing results with citations.\n\n\nBard already leverages LLMs on top of a search graph of websites and similar approaches can be used for the more narrow medical domain.\n\n\nLeveraging LLMs coupled with traditional retrieval to do deep literature search and mapping to a patient profile with residents and physicians as a last mile to interpret and make decisions (e.g. Retrieval Augmented Generation).\n\n\n[43:23] Financial incentives are important to consider to help adopt these generative language models. In healthcare, a few of these include:\n\n\nNotes are used to determine billing codes, so the more accurate they are the better for hospital systems\n\n\nPhysician efficiency can help reduce physician burnout and ideally improve patient care, but incentives are always difficult to align.\n\n\n[45:55] Bot Wars!!! Payers and Providers may both be armed with LLMs to help either bill more or fend against incorrect billings so it‚Äôs unclear how it may shake out.\n\nAndy sees providers thinking about this more perhaps because of thin margins, while payers may start to look into this only once they feel they are paying too much.\n\nInflation Reduction Act Impact on Biopharma\n[48:05] Pharma had to adjust their portfolios to deal with the reduction in profits from the reduced patent shelf life of small molecule drugs. It‚Äôs not clear if the drugs that had to be shelved due to the regulation will have an adverse impact.\nBiosecurity Risks Due to AI Drug Discovery?\nMuch like other AI technologies, is it possible for AI-based drug discovery to enable bad actors to develop biological weapons? And how do we prevent it?\n[49:49] Good area for government or an international consortium to put forth standards for risk mitigation to prevent biosafety issues.\n\nStartups could start here much like cybersecurity, but unclear how that might play out in the long term given biosecurity isn‚Äôt an existential threat for every company (but could be for governments)\n\nAdvice for Future Founders\n[51:44] Build Startups!!! And focus on a few key areas\n\n\nStart with the question: ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest challenges? What are the pain points and where are the dollars being allocated?‚Äù NOT with the technology .\n\n\nInvest in understanding the customers deeply, their sales cycles, obstacles to adoption and financial ROI. Don‚Äôt start with a deep technology and hope you find a good use case‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an uphill battle.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed this episode!!!

We‚Äôre back with another episode of the Good AI podcast - this time we sat down with a friend of mine and previous co-founder, Shabaz Patel who currently leads the Data Science team at [One Concern](oneconcern.com) to discuss the meaning of Good AI for Climate! The timing of this post happens to coincide perfectly with NeurIPS 2023, one of the biggest ML conferences in the year and a time where the top ML researchers and thought leaders meet to present their research, learn from each other and decide what to work on next.\nIn this podcast, we‚Äôre chatting with one of those researchers,\nShabaz Patel\n, who is driving novel climate analytics that build resilience for communities and enable creation of infrastructure to make businesses and economic systems resilient to natural disasters. While climate tech certainly fits the Good AI bill, we explored a bit further into what Good AI really means and what technologists can do to mitigate the effects of bad actors when releasing new tech. As always, check out the video below, short clips on Instagram or TikTok or listen on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nML Stack at\nOne Concern\n[ 0:25 ] The Technical Stack at One Concern is all based on Google Cloud.\n\n\nData Sets (public and private): stored via semantic versioning in GCS buckets.\n\n\nModels: Jupyter notebooks within K8s (GKE) to build and experiment with models\n\n\nContinual Data Pipelines: Argo is used to manage workflows\n\n\nCI / CD : cloud-based CircleCI\n\n\nMonitoring Data Stream: Great Expectations to monitor data quality\n\nData Scientists will review any anomalies\n\n\n\nData Storage: Postgres for static DB Snowflake enables easy data manipulation\n\n\n[ 7:25 ] What ML Models do you use and where they are used throughout the stack?\n\n\nData Imputation and Cleanup\n\n\nSemi-supervised techniques to generate attributes of the building (e.g. building types, construction material, etc.)\n\n\nNetwork based models to generate power network graphs which represent the grid and are useful inputs to business downtime models.\n\n\nViTs for object detection via satellite and google maps imagery to fill in the details of building features and nodes in a network.\n\n\n\n\nEnd-Customer ML Models\n\nPhysics+ML models to calculate the damage to buildings and propagating that effect to calculate business downtime from natural disasters.\n\n\n\n[ 13:10 ] How does One Concern contribute to creating a better world - Good AI?\n\n\nThe incidence of natural disasters is increasing every day, and risk is continuing to increase. Hence, climate change is top of mind for all businesses\n\n\nDisclosures are also being enforced by governments and consortiums forcing a shift to renewable sources of energy.\n\n\nOne Concern quantifies the risk profile associated with a changing climate and increased natural disaster risk, which forces companies to shift toward renewable and reliable sources of energy (e.g. power backups) so they can build a more sustainable business and reduce their overall risk profile.\n\n\n[ 19:20 ] Can you give an example of precision mitigation that businesses might take after using One Concern?\n\nDunkin‚Äô Donuts in Miami have $2M to invest and they want to identify the highest ROI location to invest in precision mitigation over the next 10-20 years depending on their time horizon. One Concern quantifies the reduced value at risk from adding mitigations like metal shutters or flood bags to locations to make more granular investment decisions.\n\nAI Risks\n[ 21:20 ] What are the risks with this AI technology? Is there a way mitigate these risks?\n\n\nBad actors are always a danger for any new technology - One Concern identifies vulnerabilities in the system which could be used to exploit those most in need.\n\n\nMitigating the bad uses of technology are possible but incentives aren‚Äôt always there - government can play a role in setting rules around the technology.\n\nWill regulatory capture only benefit the large companies who lobby for their businesses? This is not clear, which is why a balance between government and private consortiums.\n\n\n\nGood practices and guidelines are as important as the outcomes of the model. Having a balance of both process and outcomes regulation is more practical.\n\n\nAI Regulation\n[ 27:20 ] Regulated use case example: PaLM-Med is a language model focused on answering medical questions from patients or doctors.\n\n\nModel is limited even though it can perform well on the USMLE exams and requires a human in the loop to mitigate its worst effects\n\n\nRegulation for high stakes use case is critical because medical models, self-driving models and other scenarios have their own nuances.\n\n\nIndustry consortiums are another way to ensure adherence to good practices and in many ways can be more effective since peers are working together rather than adversarially as with most government regulation.\n\n\n[ 32:00 ] AGI and what it means for us today - are we really doomed or are there more benefits to be had with narrow models?\n\nWithin the ML space, there are still disagreements on whether our current architectures can get us to AGI or whether we have already achieved it in some ways via agents.\n\nAdvice for the Audience who want to make an impact\n[ 34:10 ] What is your advice for an audience that‚Äôs interested in doing something positive in the AI space? What do you wish you would have known 5 or 10 years ago?\n\n\nModel evolutions are hard to predict - but we have predictability over the 1-2 years. Invest in those techniques today and finding a burning customer need that they can solve.\n\n\nThinking about the next 5-6 years is good but only a small portion of folks need to do that and it is a high risk endeavor. Customer needs today abound leaving many more opportunities for success. Technologies can always be replaced.\n\n\nAI + Climate Opportunities on the Horizon\n[ 38:10 ] What are the opportunities for AI technologies for Climate and more broadly?\n\n\nPolitical refugees are currently a big challenge, but climate-based refugees are a problem not too far on the horizon due to displacement from areas on the globe that will become uninhabitable in the near future. Identifying and addressing this challenge can help prevent a crisis in the future.\n\nExamples: predict this and address it early, if preventable, identify scientific advancements to slow down this process, AI can help in both of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed this episode!

Entrepreneur. Leader. Podcaster. Good AI.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.‚Äù - Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nI‚Äôm an entrepreneurial, data-driven engineering leader and builder looking to Do Well by Doing Good. I live by a simple tenet embodied by the quote on my homepage: create more than I consume.\nI love to create, whether that is code, patents, papers, articles, books, music, videos, pictures‚Ä¶you name it! Work-wise I spend my time building teams to leverage ML for mission-critical business applications. For fun, I write, and build side projects. I keep myself calm and collected through the noise by running marathons and playing the piano.\nYou can learn more about my leadership and work history below.\n\nLeadership\n\n‚ÄúThe most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great at whatever they want to do.‚Äù - Kobe Bryant\n\nLeading others is a gift but requires clear vision, discipline and empathy. I have led my own startup including engineering, marketing and sales and have since been leading teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers, software engineers and managers.\nLeaders are only as good as their teams and the best teams are diverse, inclusive and have a shared sense of purpose. I strongly believe leaders must have clear cultural tenets they live by and share widely to ensure strong alignment in the teams they lead and to build a shared sense of purpose.\nI personally subscribe to the Conscious Leadership mindset characterized by 6 main cultural pillars:\n\nLeading by Example\nAction-Orientedness\nDoing Well by Doing Good\nAccountability\nHonesty, Integrity, Transparency\nHumility and Growth Mindset\n\n\nWhile the cultural leadership tenets are good to set an overall culture for all types of roles, a technical leader must also focus on key functional responsibilities (in no particular order):\n\nTechnical Excellence\nExcellent Design Docs\nSystem Architecture\nTechnical Coaching\nCross-functional Communication\nCareer Growth and Mentorship\nRecruiting\nProject Management\n\nA great technical leader must balance the needs of the business with the needs of the team through clear, concise and empathetic communication with the team, leadership and cross-functional orgs (product, BD, etc.) as well as data-driven decision-making and performance evaluation based on clear and quantitative business outcomes.\nI love each of these aspects and have been lucky enough to practice them in multiple technical leadership roles but am continually learning. Given my background is in Machine Learning, I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention that ML leadership is a bit more complex (see Software 2.0). Given the probabilistic nature of ML products, a technical leader must:\n\nManage Cross-functional Expectations\nEducate Customers and Cross-functional Leaders\nAccelerate Research to Production\n\nBuilding probabilistic products is always more difficult than deterministic ones. While the majority of customers, as the majority of the population, are less trained in statistics, even those that are well-tuned to it (e.g. biopharma, insurance, etc.) often struggle with setting the right expectations. As an ML leader it is as important to help sell the product as it is to educate customers on the capabilities, limitations and potential gotchas. The more ML products are incorporated into mission-critical systems, the more the role of an ML leader will become more ubiquitous. As an ML leader today, I aim to train the next group of ML Leaders :)\nWork History\nI have over 10 years of experience building ML-powered software teams with a deep expertise in applying Computer Vision, NLP and LLM models to customer needs and R&amp;D initiatives.

Written communication is the clearest form of communication - from daily journals, to design documents, articles about Machine Learning, Good AI and Building ML Systems, you can find me sharing on multiple platforms. I am currently writing a book - ‚ÄúMachine Learning in the Real World‚Äù to be published in 2025. I have my external works are all collated on this website but can also be found via links to other sources.\nI tend into break these topics down into a few key categories:\n\nMachine Learning in Production - Whether that is  collaborating (20170418-building-artificial-intelligence-together, 20170505-tracking-and-reproducibility-in-data-projects) or deploying (20170604-part-1-deploying-machine-learning-in-production), you might find some interesting topics in that web or my LinkedIn. Our book is related to this.\nGood AI - Being 20200606-profitable-with-a-purpose- is critical for any company, but especially for AI companies in the new paradigm. I have touched on many topics here and talked to many founders, investors and ML practitioners to continue to evolve my views.

Running is a meditative experience and allows me to do my best work. Enduring through the pain of a marathon, much like my startup journey has taught me that if you put your mind to something you can overcome it. I bring this same mentality to every endeavor.
