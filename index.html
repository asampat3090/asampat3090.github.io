								<h2 class="major">Who am I?</h2>
								<p>I'm an entrepreneurial, data-driven engineering leader and builder looking to <a href="https://dwdg.substack.com" target="_blank">Do Well by Doing Good</a>. I live by a simple tenet embodied by the quote on my homepage: create more than I consume.</p>
                                <p>I love to create, whether that is code, patents, papers, articles, books, music, videos, pictures...you name it! Work-wise I spend my time building teams to leverage ML for mission-critical business applications. For fun, I write, and build side projects.  I keep myself calm and collected through the noise by running marathons and playing the piano.</p>
                                <p>You can learn more about my leadership and work history below. </p>
                                <div class="content" style="text-align: center;">
                                    <div class="inner">

								<h2 class="major">Leadership</h2>
                                <blockquote>"The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great at whatever they want to do." - Kobe Bryant</blockquote>
								<p>Leading others is a gift but requires clear vision, discipline and empathy. I have led my own startup including engineering, marketing and sales and have since been leading teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers, software engineers and managers. 
									Leaders are only as good as their teams and the best teams are diverse, inclusive and have a shared sense of purpose. I strongly believe leaders must have clear cultural tenets they live by and share widely to ensure strong alignment in the teams they lead and to build a shared sense of purpose.</p>
                                <p>I personally subscribe to the Conscious Leadership mindset characterized by 6 main cultural pillars:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Leading by Example</li>
                                    <li>Action-Orientedness</li>
                                    <li>Doing Well by Doing Good</li>
                                    <li>Accountability</li>
                                    <li>Honesty, Integrity and Transparency</li>
                                    <li>Humility and Growth Mindset</li>
                                </ul>

                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/leadership.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>While the cultural leadership tenets are good to set an overall culture for all types of roles, a technical leader must also focus on key functional responsibilities (in no particular order): </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Technical Excellence</li>
                                    <li>Excellent Design Docs</li>
                                    <li>System Architecture</li>
                                    <li>Technical Coaching</li>
                                    <li>Cross-functional Communication</li>
                                    <li>Career Growth and Mentorship</li>
                                    <li>Recruiting</li>
                                    <li>Project Management</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>A great technical leader must balance the needs of the business with the needs of the team through clear, concise and empathetic communication with the team, leadership and cross-functional orgs (product, BD, etc.) as well as data-driven decision-making and performance evaluation based on clear and quantitative business outcomes.</p>
                                <p>I love each of these aspects and have been lucky enough to practice them in multiple technical leadership roles but am continually learning. Given my background is in Machine Learning, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that ML leadership is a bit more complex (see <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35" target="_blank">Software 2.0</a>). Given the probabilistic nature of ML products, a technical leader must:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Manage Cross-functional Expectations</li>
                                    <li>Educate Customers and Cross-functional Leaders</li>
                                    <li>Accelerate Research to Production</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>Building probabilistic products is always more difficult than deterministic ones. While the majority of customers, as the majority of the population, are less trained in statistics, even those that are well-tuned to it (e.g. biopharma, insurance, etc.) often struggle with setting the right expecations. As an ML leader it is as important to help sell the product as it is to educate customers on the capabilities, limitations and potential gotchas. The more ML products are incorporated into mission-critical systems, the more the role of an ML leader will become more ubiquitous. As an ML leader today, I aim to train the next group of ML Leaders :)  </p>

								<h2 class="major">🎹 Music</h2>
								<p>I love making music. I play the piano, guitar,ukelele and often remix my own songs. From classical to Bollywood, Pop and more, I enjoy bringing together all genres of music. You can find my work on Soundcloud and TikTok!</p>
                                <p>I also am a fan of Bollywood dance - I've heard you can find videos online if you look hard enough 😊 </p>

								<h2 class="major">🏃🏽‍♂️ Marathons</h2>
								<p>I have completed over 8 marathons and over 15 other shorter races (5k, half, etc). I qualified (sub-3 hour marathon time) and ran the Boston Marathon in 2020 and 2021 and felt great the whole way thanks to the amazing crowd. Running is a meditative experience and allows me to do my best work. Enduring through the pain of a marathon, much like my startup journey has taught me that if you put your mind to something you can overcome it. I bring this same mentality to every endeavor. You can follow me on Strava!</p>
